  abstract  = {The open-endedness of a system is often defined as a continual production of novelty. Here we pin down this concept more fully by defining several types of novelty that a system may exhibit, classified as variation, innovation, and emergence. We then provide a meta-model for including levels of structure in a system’s model. From there, we define an architecture suitable for building simulations of open-ended novelty-generating systems and discuss how previously proposed systems fit into this framework. We discuss the design principles applicable to those systems and close with some challenges for the community.},

The formation of the atmospheric sciences will be illustrated by two case studies: the foundation and development since 1968 of the first department of atmospheric chemistry in the Max Planck Society (Max-Planck-Gesellschaft, MPG) and the collaborative research program “atmospheric tracegases” initiated in 1970 by the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG).},

  abstract  = {RNA molecules have served for decades as a paradigmatic example of molecular evolution that is tractable both in in vitro experiments and in detailed computer simulation. The adaptation of RNA sequences to external selection pressures is well studied and well understood. The de novo innovation or optimization of RNA aptamers and riboswitches in SELEX experiments serves as a case in point. Likewise, fitness landscapes building upon the efficiently computable RNA secondary structures have been a key toward understanding realistic fitness landscapes. Much less is known, however, on models in which multiple RNAs interact with each other, thus actively influencing the selection pressures acting on them. From a computational perspective, RNA–RNA interactions can be dealt with by same basic methods as the folding of a single RNA molecule, although many details become more complicated. RNA–RNA interactions are frequently employed in cellular regulation networks, e.g., as miRNA bases mRNA silencing or in the modulation of bacterial mRNAs by small, often highly structured sRNAs. In this chapter, we summarize the key features of networks of replicators. We highlight the differences between quasispecies-like models describing templates copied by an external replicase and hypercycle similar to autocatalytic replicators. Two aspects are of importance: the dynamics of selection within a population, usually described by conventional dynamical systems, and the evolution of replicating species in the space of chemical types. Product inhibition plays a key role in modulating selection dynamics from survival of the fittest to extinction of unfittest. The sequence evolution of replicators is rather well understood as approximate optimization in a fitness landscape for templates that is shaped by the sequence-structure map of RNA. Some of the properties of this map, in particular shape space covering and extensive neutral networks, give rise to evolutionary patterns such as drift-like motion in sequence space, akin to the behavior of RNA quasispecies. In contrast, very little is known about the influence of sequence-structure maps on autocatalytic replication systems.},

  abstract  = {Traditional way of problem solving tries to deliver data to program. But when the problem’s complexity exponentially increases as the data scale increases, to obtain the solution is difficult. Group cooperation computing model works in an inverse way by delivering program to data. It first models each single data as individual and data unit as group of individuals. Then, different cooperation rules are designed for individuals to cooperate with each other. Finally, the solution of the problem emerges through individuals’ cooperation process. This study applies group cooperation computing model to solve Hamilton Path problem which has NP-complete time complexity. Experiment results show that the cooperation model works much better than genetic algorithm. More importantly, the following properties of group cooperation computing are found which may be different from the traditional computing theory. (1) By using different cooperation rules, the same problem with the same scale may exhibit different complexities, such as liner or exponent. (2) By using the same cooperation rule, when the problem scale is less than a specific threshold, the problem’s time complexity is liner. Otherwise, the problem complexity may be exponent.},

The reviewed applications include the garbage can model of organizational choice, the usage of cellular automata and of the NK model in order to investigate various problems of organizational interdependencies, and realistic agent-based models of agile productive plants. Possible future applications may include employing unsupervised neural networks in applied research on organizational routines, as well as employing sophisticated models of organizational evolution in order to understand such neglected features as punctuated equilibria and exaptation. Given the scope of the research agendas that ABMg can provide, it is quite surprising that this tool has been largely ignored by organization science hitherto. One possible explanation is that ABMg, which presents itself as a computational technique, inadvertently conceives its very nature of a tool for the exploration of novel research hypotheses. It is eventually perceived by non-practitioners as one more statistical technique for the validation of given hypotheses, and possibly a needlessly complex one.},

This modern approach makes it possible to use a history of the adaptive process for a construction of its actual solution. If we compare, on one hand, the usage of the concept of collective memory in social sciences, and, on the other hand, its usage in artificial intelligence, we observe that there exist many common properties that substantially simplify a discussion of their common interaction and interpretation.},

When autopoietic systems overlap or blend with each other, they create new typologies according to their behavioral characteristics. This blending also produces a larger complex second level union of interaction that involves how we relate to an artwork and how we can critique those aesthetic experiences. Through the installation artworks of Ken Rinaldo and the robotic sculptures of Simon Penny, this chapter explores how these works are viewed within the autopoietic model of interactivity and aesthetic generation.},

Ideas are also taken from the evolving micro-controller research. This new model replaces micro-controllers by simple matrix operations. These matrices, seen as abstract proteins, work on abstract genomes, peptides or other proteins. Studying the evolutionary properties shows that the protein-only hypothesis (proteins as active elements) shows poor evolvability and the RNA-before-protein hypothesis (genomes controlling) exhibits similar intricate evolutionary dynamics as in the micro-controller model. A simple possible explanation for this surprising difference in behavior is presented. In addition to existing evolutionary models, dynamical and organizational changes or transitions occurring late in long-term experiments are demonstrated.},

  abstract  = {We present a model for genome size evolution that takes into account both local mutations such as small insertions and small deletions, and large chromosomal rearrangements such as duplications and large deletions. We introduce the possibility of undergoing several mutations within one generation. The model, albeit minimalist, reveals a non-trivial spontaneous dynamics of genome size: in the absence of selection, an arbitrary large part of genomes remains beneath a finite size, even for a duplication rate 2.6-fold higher than the rate of large deletions, and even if there is also a systematic bias toward small insertions compared to small deletions. Specifically, we show that the condition of existence of an asymptotic stationary distribution for genome size non-trivially depends on the rates and mean sizes of the different mutation types. We also give upper bounds for the median and other quantiles of the genome size distribution, and argue that these bounds cannot be overcome by selection. Taken together, our results show that the spontaneous dynamics of genome size naturally prevents it from growing infinitely, even in cases where intuition would suggest an infinite growth. Using quantitative numerical examples, we show that, in practice, a shrinkage bias appears very quickly in genomes undergoing mutation accumulation, even though DNA gains and losses appear to be perfectly symmetrical at first sight. We discuss this spontaneous dynamics in the light of the other evolutionary forces proposed in the literature and argue that it provides them a stability-related size limit below which they can act.},

Although the possibility to reproduce this emergence in laboratory has received considerable attention, this is still far from being achieved.In order to unravel some key properties enabling the emergence of structures potentially able to sustain their own existence and growth, in this work we investigate the probability to observe them in ensembles of random catalytic reaction networks characterized by different structural properties.From the point of view of network topology, an autocatalytic set have been defined either in term of strongly connected components (SCCs) or as reflexively autocatalytic and food-generated sets (RAFs).We observe that the average level of catalysis differently affects the probability to observe a SCC or a RAF, highlighting the existence of a region where the former can be observed, whereas the latter cannot. This parameter also affects the composition of the RAF, which can be further characterized into linear structures, autocatalysis or SCCs.Interestingly, we show that the different network topology (uniform as opposed to power-law catalysis systems) does not have a significantly divergent impact on SCCs and RAFs appearance, whereas the proportion between cleavages and condensations seems instead to play a role.A major factor that limits the probability of RAF appearance and that may explain some of the difficulties encountered in laboratory seems to be the presence of molecules which can accumulate without being substrate or catalyst of any reaction.},

  abstract  = {The powerful mathematical tools developed for the study of large scale reaction networks have given rise to applications of this framework beyond the scope of biochemistry. Recently, reaction networks have been suggested as an alternative way to model social phenomena. In this “socio-chemical metaphor” molecular species play the role of agents’ decisions and their outcomes, and chemical reactions play the role of interactions among these decisions. From here, it is possible to study the dynamical properties of social systems using standard tools of biochemical modelling. In this work we show how to use reaction networks to model systems that are usually studied via evolutionary game theory. We first illustrate our framework by modeling the repeated prisoners’ dilemma. The model is built from the payoff matrix together with assumptions of the agents’ memory and recognizability capacities. The model provides consistent results concerning the performance of the agents, and allows for the examination of the steady states of the system in a simple manner. We further develop a model considering the interaction among Tit for Tat and Defector agents. We produce analytical results concerning the performance of the strategies in different situations of agents’ memory and recognizability. This approach unites two important theories and may produce new insights in classical problems such as the evolution of cooperation in large scale systems.},

  abstract  = {Engineering design has traditionally been a top-down process in which a designer shapes, arranges and combines various components in a specific, precise, hierarchical manner, to create an artifact that will behave deterministically in an intended way (Minai et al. 2006; Pahl et al. 2007). However, this process does not apply to complex systems that show self-organization, adaptation and emergence. Complex systems consist of a massive amount of simpler components that are coupled locally and loosely, whose behaviors at macroscopic scales emerge partially stochastically in a bottom-up way. Such emergent properties of complex systems are often very robust and dynamically adaptive to the surrounding environment, indicating that complex systems bear great potential for engineering applications (Ottino 2004).},

Due to the discrete manner of molecular assembly in cell signalling and gene regulation, we define a framework of membrane systems equipped with discretised forms of reaction kinetics in concert with variable intramolecular structures. Our first study is dedicated to circadian clocks inducing daily biological rhythms. As an inspiring example, the KaiABC core oscillator reaches its functionality by cyclically varying protein structures. Within our second study, we present a meta-model of an entire circadian clockwork able to adapt its oscillation to an external stimulus in terms of a frequency control system acting in a phase-locked loop. Substrate concentration courses resulting from gene expression reflect its oscillatory behaviour utilised in a periodical trigger for subsequent processes. In this context, our third study cytometrically quantifies the dynamical behaviour of a bistable toggle switch resulting from mutual gene regulation.},

  abstract  = {Generally, phenomena of spontaneous pattern formation are random and repetitive, whereas elaborate devices are the deterministic product of human design. Yet, biological organisms and collective insect constructions are exceptional examples of complex systems (CS) that are both architectured and self-organized. Can we understand their precise self-formation capabilities and integrate them with technological planning? Can physical systems be endowed with information, or informational systems be embedded in physics, to create autonomous morphologies and functions? To answer these questions, we have launched in 2009, and developed through a series of workshops and a collective book, a new field of research called morphogenetic engineering. It is the first initiative of its kind to rally and promote models and implementations of complex self-architecturing systems. Particular emphasis is set on the programmability and computational abilities of self-organization, properties that are often underappreciated in CS science—while, conversely, the benefits of self-organization are often underappreciated in engineering methodologies.

Today, graphics cards are used for general purpose computing which has been made easier thanks to frameworks like CUDA or OpenCL. Parallelization of models may however not be easy: parallel computer programing skills are often required; several hardware architectures may be used to execute models. In this paper, we present the software architecture we built in order to implement various models able to simulate multi-cellular system. This architecture is modular and it implements data structures adapted for graphics processing units architectures. It allows efficient simulation of biological mechanisms.},

It can also be used to perform computations inspired by chemistry, including heuristic optimization algorithms akin to evolutionary algorithms, among other usages. Artificial chemistries are conceptually parallel computations, and could greatly benefit from parallel computer architectures for their simulation, especially as GPU hardware becomes widespread and affordable. However, in practice it is difficult to parallelize artificial chemistry algorithms efficiently for GPUs, particularly in the case of stochastic simulation algorithms that model individual molecular collisions and take chemical kinetics into account. This chapter surveys the current state of the art in the techniques for parallelizing artificial chemistries on GPUs, with focus on their stochastic simulation and their applications in the evolutionary computation domain. Since this problem is far from being entirely solved to satisfaction, some suggestions for future research are also outlined.},

  abstract  = {BackgroundModeling molecules as undirected graphs and chemical reactions as graph rewriting operations is a natural and convenient approach to modeling chemistry. Graph grammar rules are most naturally employed to model elementary reactions like merging, splitting, and isomerisation of molecules. It is often convenient, in particular in the analysis of larger systems, to summarize several subsequent reactions into a single composite chemical reaction.ResultsWe introduce a generic approach for composing graph grammar rules to define a chemically useful rule compositions. We iteratively apply these rule compositions to elementary transformations in order to automatically infer complex transformation patterns. As an application we automatically derive the overall reaction pattern of the Formose cycle, namely two carbonyl groups that can react with a bound glycolaldehyde to a second glycolaldehyde. Rule composition also can be used to study polymerization reactions as well as more complicated iterative reaction schemes. Terpenes and the polyketides, for instance, form two naturally occurring classes of compounds of utmost pharmaceutical interest that can be understood as “generalized polymers” consisting of five-carbon (isoprene) and two-carbon units, respectively.ConclusionThe framework of graph transformations provides a valuable set of tools to generate and investigate large networks of chemical networks. Within this formalism, rule composition is a canonical technique to obtain coarse-grained representations that reflect, in a natural way, “effective” reactions that are obtained by lumping together specific combinations of elementary reactions.},

Recent scientific and technical developments make it possible to make the transition from passively understanding to actively using evolutionary processes. Today this is possible in Evolutionary Computing, where human experimenters can design and manipulate all components of evolutionary processes in digital spaces. We argue that in the near future it will be possible to implement artificial evolutionary processes outside such imaginary spaces and make them physically embodied. In other words, we envision the “Evolution of Things”, rather than just the evolution of digital objects, leading to a new field of Embodied Artificial Evolution (EAE). The main objective of this paper is to present a unifying vision in order to aid the development of this high potential research area. To this end, we introduce the notion of EAE, discuss a few examples and applications, and elaborate on the expected benefits as well as the grand challenges this developing field will have to address.},

When and under what conditions could primordial metabolism run by generalist enzymes evolve to contemporary-type metabolism run by specific enzymes?ResultsHere we show by numerical simulation of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction chain that specialist enzymes spread after the invention of the chromosome because protocells harbouring unlinked genes maintain largely non-specific enzymes to reduce their assortment load. When genes are linked on chromosomes, high enzyme specificity evolves because it increases biomass production, also by reducing taxation by side reactions.ConclusionThe constitution of the genetic system has a profound influence on the limits of metabolic efficiency. The major evolutionary transition to chromosomes is thus proven to be a prerequisite for a complex metabolism.

These structures are considered to be the result of finely tuned and genetically encoded developmental pathways. The amount of encoded information needed to generate and manipulate these structures is poorly understood. Investigating the dynamics of spontaneous pattern formation in non-biological systems provides insights to the physio-chemical phenomena that biological systems must have harnessed for living systems and that modern scientists need to understand for complex nano-technological applications.ResultsHere we show that highly complex, precipitation patterns similar to those found in biological systems can be formed in simple Cu(II)-oxalate systems. In these Cu(II)-oxalate systems, structures are constructed by a hierarchy of multiple processes that are precisely self-organized in space and time to form interconnected causal networks that generate complex and diverse structures dependent on construction trajectories that can be controlled by minor variations of initial conditions.ConclusionsHighly complex precipitation patterns similar to those found in biological systems can be generated without a correspondingly complex set of instructions. Our result has implications for understanding early biotic systems that existed prior to the evolution of sophisticated genetic machinery. From an applications perspective, processes and structures that occur spontaneously are the building blocks for novel system chemistry based technologies where products are self-constructed. We also provide a simple model of chemical system that generates biomimetic structures for the study of fundamental processes involved in chemical self-construction.},

Both speculation and experiments present several difficulties that call for the development of faithful and accessible abstract models of the phenomena investigated. Several theories and techniques born in computer science have been proposed for the development of models that rely on solid formal bases and allow virtual experiments to be carried out computationally in silico.This chapter surveys the basics of process calculi and their applications to the modeling of biological phenomena at a system level. Process calculi were born within the theory of concurrency for describing and proving properties of distributed interacting systems. Their application to biological phenomena relies on an interpretation of systems as made of interacting components exhibiting a computational kind of behavior, “cells as computation.”The first seminal proposals and the subsequent enhancements for best adapting computer science theories to the domain of biology (with particular reference to chemical, biochemical, and cellular phenomena) are surveyed.},

Artifacts are realized as swarms of multiple types of very simple, kinetically interacting particles with no elaborate sensing, computation, or communication capabilities. The proposed framework is based on our earlier work, Swarm Chemistry, a computational model of particle swarms where mobile particles with different kinetic properties interact with each other to produce dynamic structures and behaviors spontaneously. The features of emergent patterns are implicitly encoded through interactive evolutionary design methods into a set of kinetic parameter values, called a recipe. In this chapter, we summarize several extensions of the model for morphogenetic engineering and demonstrate a variety of morphogenetic processes that can be achieved by using simple particles with minimal capability. Specifically, we show (1) diversity of self-organizing patterns that can be generated by simple particle swarms in our framework, (2) robustness of those patterns against external perturbations, (3) growth and self-assembly by local information transmission between particles and their stochastic differentiation, and (4) self-repair by stochastic re-differentiation of particles.},

This chapter highlights the benefits of relying on an algorithmic approach to model, simulate, and analyze biological systems. The key techniques surveyed are related to programming languages and concurrency theory as they are the main tools to express in an executable form the key feature of computing: algorithms and the coupling executor/execution of descriptions.

  abstract  = {Over the past two decades, many techniques have been elaborated to simulate artificial, robotic creatures at different scales. After behavioral models in the 1990s, researchers made the robot morphologies evolvable to be better adapted to their environment. More recently, developmental mechanisms of living beings have inspired “artificial embryogeny” and generated smaller creatures composed of tens to thousands of cells. Yet, there is no encompassing “transversal” model that covers multiple scales at once. To address this challenge, our project consists of growing a complete creature with various organs and high-level functionalities from a single cell. For this, we propose a developmental model, Cell2Organ, based on three simulation layers. The first layer represents a chemical solution, in which cells can divide and process substrates through chemical reactions. Its purpose is to develop a metabolism adapted to the environment and allow organisms to perform actions by using accumulated energy. We also present an alternative model for the chemical layer that replaces molecular morphogens with a generative process based on L-systems. The second layer is a hydrodynamic medium, in which cells interact with simulated substrate flows so that they can impact the whole environment. Finally, we describe our plan to extend Cell2Organ with a third, physical layer, which would allow creatures to exhibit motion in a Newtonian world. There, cells will be able to modify their individual shape and affect the overall morphology of the organism.},

We then close the loop by discussing metabolism-repair systems and describe the rationality of the self-referential equation f = f (f). This relationship is derived from some boundary conditions that, in molecular systems biology, can be stated as the cardinality of the following molecular sets must be about equal: metabolome, genome, proteome. We show that this conjecture is not likely correct so the problem of self-referential mappings for describing the boundary between living and nonliving systems remains an open question. We calculate a lower and upper bound for the number of edges in the molecular interaction network (the interactome) for two cellular organisms and for two manufacturomes for CMOS integrated circuit manufacturing.ConclusionsWe show that the relevant mapping relations may not be Abelian, and that these problems cannot yet be resolved because the interactomes and manufacturomes are incomplete.},

  abstract  = {The paper presents a model of coevolution of short peptides (P) and short oligonucleotides (N) at an early stage of chemical evolution leading to the origin of life. The model describes polymerization of both P and N types of molecules on mineral surfaces in aqueous solution at moderate temperatures. It is assumed that amino acid and nucleotide monomers were available in a prebiotic milieu, that periodic variation in environmental conditions between dry/warm and wet/cool took place and that energy sources were available for the polymerization. An artificial chemistry approach in combination with agent-based modeling was used to explore chemical evolution from an initially random mixture of monomers. It was assumed that the oligonucleotides could serve as templates for self-replication and for translation of peptide compositional sequences, and that certain peptides could serve as weak catalysts. Important features of the model are the short lengths of the peptide and oligonucleotide molecules that prevent an error catastrophe caused by copying errors and a finite diffusion rate of the molecules on a mineral surface that prevents excessive development of parasitism. The result of the simulation was the emergence of self-replicating molecular systems consisting of peptide catalysts and oligonucleotide templates. In addition, a smaller but significant number of molecules with alternative compositions also survived due to imprecise reproduction and translation of templates providing variability for further evolution. In a more general context, the model describes not only peptide-oligonucleotide molecular systems, but any molecular system containing two types of polymer molecules: one of which serves as templates and the other as catalysts.The presented coevolutionary system suggests a possible direction towards finding the origin of molecular functionality in a prebiotic environment.},

The arguments supporting that opinion have recently come under scrutiny and been found wanting. Nevertheless, the appearance of increasing complexity remains. So, is there some sense in which evolution does grow complexity? Artificial life simulations have consistently failed to reproduce even the appearance of increasing complexity, which poses a challenge. Simulations, as much as scientific theories, are obligated at least to save the appearances! We suggest a relation between these two problems, understanding biological complexity growth and the failure to model even its appearances. We present a different understanding of that complexity which evolution grows, one that genuinely runs counter to entropy and has thus far eluded proper analysis in information-theoretic terms. This complexity is reflected best in the increase in niches within the biosystem as a whole. Past and current artificial life simulations lack the resources with which to grow niches and so to reproduce evolution’s complexity. We propose a more suitable simulation design integrating environments and organisms, allowing old niches to change and new ones to emerge.},

Based on this discussion, we move on to evaluate typical artificial chemistry systems: We propose 13 conditions necessary for emergent evolution and three topological conditions that must be met by the rules for transport of symbols. We also introduce the concept of a molecular network, which emulates the spatial relationship of the molecules. With hard-sphere random-walk simulations, we show seven topological conditions that the molecular network must satisfy. In the latter half of this chapter, we feature the example of network artificial chemistry (NAC), in which a molecular network is used for spatial representation, and present some of the research results derived since this was first proposed. We begin by introducing a model wherein a cluster formed by folding a node chain functions as an active machine. We then overview studies on rewiring rules for weak edges, which form the basis for network dynamics. We discuss the merits and demerits of the method expressing spatial constraints derived from the network energy, then introduce models devised to circumvent the difficulties: a model that implements active functions (programs) in the nodes and an improved model that implements the programs in agents to allow them to move within the network. The improved model, called “program-flow computing,” is expected to be refined into a new computing model.},

This could partly explain some undesirable phenomena such as unlimited elongation of strings in these chemistries, in contrast to nature where polymerization tends to be unfavored. In this paper, we show that a simple yet sufficiently accurate energy model can efficiently steer resource usage, in particular for the case of elongation control. A string chemistry is constructed on purpose to make strings grow arbitrarily large. Simulation results show that the addition of energy control alone is able to keep the molecules within reasonable length bounds, even without mass conservation, and without explicit length thresholds. A narrow energy range is detected where the system neither stays inert nor grows unbounded. At this operating point, interesting phenomena often emerge, such as clusters of autocatalytic molecules, which seem to cooperate.},

  abstract  = {Bacteria offer an evolutionary model in which rich interactions between phenotype and genotype lead to compact genomes with efficient metabolic pathways. We seek an analogous computational process that supports a rich artificial heredity. These systems can be simulated by stochastic chemistry models, but there is currently no scope for open-ended evolution of the molecular species that make up the models. Instruction-set based Artifical Life has appropriate evolutionary properties, but the individual is represented as a single executing sequence with little additional physiology. We describe a novel combination of stochastic chemistries and evolvable molecule microprograms that gives a rich evolutionary framework. A single organism is represented by a set of exectuing sequences. Key to this approach is the use of inexact sequence matching for binding between individual molecules and for branching of molecular microprograms. We illustrate the approach by implementation of two steady-state replicase RNA analogues that demonstrate “invasion when rare”.},

  abstract  = {In human genetics a primary goal is the discovery of genetic factors that predict individual susceptibility to common human diseases, but this has proven difficult to achieve because these diseases are likely to result from the joint failure of two or more interacting components. Currently geneticists measure genetic variations from across the genomes of individuals with and without the disease. The association of single variants with disease is then assessed. Our goal is to develop methods capable of identifying combinations of genetic variations predictive of discrete measures of health in human population data. “Artificial evolution” approaches loosely based on real biological processes have been developed and applied, but it has recently been suggested that “computational evolution” approaches will be more likely to solve problems of interest to biomedical researchers. Here we introduce a method to evolve parsimonious solutions in an open-ended computational evolution framework that more closely mimics the complexity of biological systems. In ecological systems a highly specialized organism can fail to thrive as the environment changes. By introducing numerous small changes into training data, i.e. the environment, during evolution we drive evolution towards general solutions. We show that this method leads to smaller solutions and does not reduce the power of an open-ended computational evolution system. This method of environmental perturbation fits within the computational evolution framework and is an effective method of evolving parsimonious solutions.},

  abstract  = {In this paper we propose a new bottom-up approach to cellular computing, in which computational chemical processes are encapsulated within liposomes. This “liposome logic” approach (also called vesicle computing) makes use of supra-molecular chemistry constructs, e.g. protocells, chells, etc. as minimal cellular platforms to which logical functionality can be added. Modeling and simulations feature prominently in “top-down” synthetic biology, particularly in the specification, design and implementation of logic circuits through bacterial genome reengineering. The second contribution in this paper is the demonstration of a novel set of tools for the specification, modelling and analysis of “bottom-up” liposome logic. In particular, simulation and modelling techniques are used to analyse some example liposome logic designs, ranging from relatively simple NOT gates and NAND gates to SR-Latches, D Flip-Flops all the way to 3 bit ripple counters. The approach we propose consists of specifying, by means of P systems, gene regulatory network-like systems operating inside proto-membranes. This P systems specification can be automatically translated and executed through a multiscaled pipeline composed of dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulator and Gillespie’s stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA). Finally, model selection and analysis can be performed through a model checking phase. This is the first paper we are aware of that brings to bear formal specifications, DPD, SSA and model checking to the problem of modeling target computational functionality in protocells. Potential chemical routes for the laboratory implementation of these simulations are also discussed thus for the first time suggesting a potentially realistic physiochemical implementation for membrane computing from the bottom-up.},

  abstract  = {BackgroundThe metabolic architectures of extant organisms share many key pathways such as the citric acid cycle, glycolysis, or the biosynthesis of most amino acids. Several competing hypotheses for the evolutionary mechanisms that shape metabolic networks have been discussed in the literature, each of which finds support from comparative analysis of extant genomes. Alternatively, the principles of metabolic evolution can be studied by direct computer simulation. This requires, however, an explicit implementation of all pertinent components: a universe of chemical reactions upon which the metabolism is built, an explicit representation of the enzymes that implement the metabolism, a genetic system that encodes these enzymes, and a fitness function that can be selected for.ResultsWe describe here a simulation environment that implements all these components in a simplified way so that large-scale evolutionary studies are feasible. We employ an artificial chemistry that views chemical reactions as graph rewriting operations and utilizes a toy-version of quantum chemistry to derive thermodynamic parameters. Minimalist organisms with simple string-encoded genomes produce model ribozymes whose catalytic activity is determined by an ad hoc mapping between their secondary structure and the transition state graphs that they stabilize. Fitness is computed utilizing the ideas of metabolic flux analysis. We present an implementation of the complete system and first simulation results.ConclusionsThe simulation system presented here allows coherent investigations into the evolutionary mechanisms of the first steps of metabolic evolution using a self-consistent toy universe.},

  abstract  = {BackgroundWe suggest a new type of modeling approach for the coarse grained, particle-based spatial simulation of combinatorially complex chemical reaction systems. In our approach molecules possess a location in the reactor as well as an orientation and geometry, while the reactions are carried out according to a list of implicitly specified reaction rules. Because the reaction rules can contain patterns for molecules, a combinatorially complex or even infinitely sized reaction network can be defined.For our implementation (based on LAMMPS), we have chosen an already existing formalism (BioNetGen) for the implicit specification of the reaction network. This compatibility allows to import existing models easily, i.e., only additional geometry data files have to be provided.ResultsOur simulations show that the obtained dynamics can be fundamentally different from those simulations that use classical reaction-diffusion approaches like Partial Differential Equations or Gillespie-type spatial stochastic simulation. We show, for example, that the combination of combinatorial complexity and geometric effects leads to the emergence of complex self-assemblies and transportation phenomena happening faster than diffusion (using a model of molecular walkers on microtubules). When the mentioned classical simulation approaches are applied, these aspects of modeled systems cannot be observed without very special treatment. Further more, we show that the geometric information can even change the organizational structure of the reaction system. That is, a set of chemical species that can in principle form a stationary state in a Differential Equation formalism, is potentially unstable when geometry is considered, and vice versa.ConclusionsWe conclude that our approach provides a new general framework filling a gap in between approaches with no or rigid spatial representation like Partial Differential Equations and specialized coarse-grained spatial simulation systems like those for DNA or virus capsid self-assembly.},

The origin of this symmetry breaking is a long-standing question in molecular evolution. Previous models addressing this question include particular kinetic properties such as autocatalysis or negative cross catalysis.ResultsWe propose here a more general kinetic formalism for early enantioselection, based on our previously described Graded Autocatalysis Replication Domain (GARD) model for prebiotic evolution in molecular assemblies. This model is adapted here to the case of chiral molecules by applying symmetry constraints to mutual molecular recognition within the assembly. The ensuing dynamics shows spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, with transitions towards stationary compositional states (composomes) enriched with one of the two enantiomers for some of the constituent molecule types. Furthermore, one or the other of the two antipodal compositional states of the assembly also shows time-dependent selection.ConclusionIt follows that chiral selection may be an emergent consequence of early catalytic molecular networks rather than a prerequisite for the initiation of primeval life processes. Elaborations of this model could help explain the prevalent chiral homogeneity in present-day living cells.ReviewersThis article was reviewed by Boris Rubinstein (nominated by Arcady Mushegian), Arcady Mushegian, Meir Lahav (nominated by Yitzhak Pilpel) and Sergei Maslov.},

Since John Von Neumann and Alan Turing pioneering works on self-replication and morphogenesis, proponents of artificial life have chosen to resolutely neglecting a lot of materialistic and quantitative information deemed not indispensable and have focused on the rule-based mechanisms making life possible, supposedly neutral with respect to their underlying material embodiment. Minimal life begins at the intersection of a series of processes which need to be isolated, differentiated and duplicated as such in computers. Only software developments and running make possible to understand the way these processes are intimately interconnected in order for life to appear at the crossroad. In this paper, I will attempt to set out the history of life as the disciples of artificial life understand it, by placing these different lessons on a temporal and causal axis, showing which one is indispensable to the appearance of the next and how does it connect to the next. I will discuss the task of artificial life as setting up experimental software platforms where these different lessons, whether taken in isolation or together, are tested, simulated, and, more systematically, analyzed. I will sketch some of these existing software platforms: chemical reaction networks, Varela’s autopoietic cellular automata, Ganti’s chemoton model, whose running delivers interesting take home messages to open-minded biologists.},

This logic, presented here, as the bio-logic of artificial creature, needs not only newsimulators such as chemical or hydrodynamic environments but also new mechanisms such as an artificial regulatory network to control the development process.

  abstract  = {The chronologic age classically used in demography is often unable to give useful information about which exact stage in development or aging processes has reached an organism. Hence, we propose here to explain in some applications for what reason the chronologic age fails in explaining totally the observed state of an organism, which leads to propose a new notion, the biological age. This biological age is essentially determined by the number of divisions before the Hayflick’s limit the tissue or mitochondrion in a critical organ (in the sense where its loss causes the death of the whole organism) has already used for its development and adult phases. We give a precise definition of the biological age of an organ based on the Hayflick’s limit of its cells and we introduce a desynchronization index (the cell entropy) for some critical tissues or membranes, which are mainly skin, intestinal endothelium, alveoli epithelium and mitochondrial inner membrane. In these actively metabolising interface tissues or membranes, there is a rapid turnover of cells, of their cytoplasmic constituents such as proteins, and of membrane lipids. The boundaries corresponding to these tissues, cells or membranes have vital functions of interface with the environment (protection, homeothermy, nutrition and respiration) and have a rapid turnover (the total cell renewal time is in mice equal to 3 weeks for the skin, 1.5 day for the intestine, 4 months for the alveolae and 11 days for mitochondrial inner membrane) conditioning their biological age. The biological age of a tissue is made of two major components: (1) first, its embryonic age based on the distance (in number of divisions) between the birth date of its first differentiated cell and the time until it reaches its final boundary at the end of its development and (2) second, its adult age whose complement until its death is just the lapse of time made of the sum of remaining cell cycle durations authorized by its Hayflick’s limit. From this definition, we calculate the global biological lifespan of an organism and revisit notions like demographic survival curves, duration and synchrony of cell cycles, living boundaries from proto-cells to organs, and embryonic and adult phases duration.},

  abstract  = {The Graded Autocatalysis Replication Domain (GARD) model describes an origin of life scenario which involves non-covalent compositional assemblies, made of monomeric mutually catalytic molecules. GARD constitutes an alternative to informational biopolymers as a mechanism of primordial inheritance. In the present work, we examined the effect of mutations, one of the most fundamental mechanisms for evolution, in the context of the networks of mutual interaction within GARD prebiotic assemblies. We performed a systematic analysis analogous to single and double gene deletions within GARD. While most deletions have only a small effect on both growth rate and molecular composition of the assemblies, ~10% of the deletions caused lethality, or sometimes showed enhanced fitness. Analysis of 14 different network properties on 2,000 different GARD networks indicated that lethality usually takes place when the deleted node has a high molecular count, or when it is a catalyst for such node. A correlation was also found between lethality and node degree centrality, similar to what is seen in real biological networks. Addressing double knockout mutations, our results demonstrate the occurrence of both synthetic lethality and extragenic suppression within GARD networks, and convey an attempt to correlate synthetic lethality to network node-pair properties. The analyses presented help establish GARD as a workable alternative prebiotic scenario, suggesting that life may have begun with large molecular networks of low fidelity, that later underwent evolutionary compaction and fidelity augmentation.},

  abstract  = {Computational models of emotions have been thriving and increasingly popular since the 1990s. Such models used to be concerned with the emotions of individual agents when they interact with other agents. Out of the array of models for the emotions, we are going to devote special attention to the approach in Adamatzky’s Dynamics of Crowd-Minds. The reason it stands out, is that it considers the crowd, rather than the individual agent. It fits in computational intelligence. It works by mathematical simulation on a crowd of simple artificial agents: by letting the computer program run, the agents evolve, and crowd behaviour emerges. Adamatzky’s purpose is to give an account of the emergence of allegedly “irrational” behaviour. This is not without problem, as the irrational to one person may seem entirely rational to another, and this in turn is an insight that, in the history of crowd psychology, has affected indeed the competition among theories of crowd dynamics. Quite importantly, Adamatzky’s book argues for the transition from individual agencies to a crowd’s or a mob’s coalesced mind as so, and at any rate for coalesced crowd’s agency.},

  abstract  = {This article deals with the links between the enaction paradigm and artificial intelligence. Enaction is considered a metaphor for artificial intelligence, as a number of the notions which it deals with are deemed incompatible with the phenomenal field of the virtual. After explaining this stance, we shall review previous works regarding this issue in terms of artificial life and robotics. We shall focus on the lack of recognition of co-evolution at the heart of these approaches. We propose to explicitly integrate the evolution of the environment into our approach in order to refine the ontogenesis of the artificial system, and to compare it with the enaction paradigm. The growing complexity of the ontogenetic mechanisms to be activated can therefore be compensated by an interactive guidance system emanating from the environment. This proposition does not however, resolve that of the relevance of the meaning created by the machine (sense-making). Such reflections lead us to integrate human interaction into this environment in order to construct relevant meaning in terms of participative artificial intelligence. This raises a number of questions with regards to setting up an enactive interaction. The article concludes by exploring a number of issues, thereby enabling us to associate current approaches with the principles of morphogenesis, guidance, the phenomenology of interactions and the use of minimal enactive interfaces in setting up experiments which will deal with the problem of artificial intelligence in a variety of enaction-based ways.},

  abstract  = {BackgroundResource cycling is a defining process in the maintenance of the biosphere. Microbial communities, ranging from simple to highly diverse, play a crucial role in this process. Yet the evolutionary adaptation and speciation of micro-organisms have rarely been studied in the context of resource cycling. In this study, our basic questions are how does a community evolve its resource usage and how are resource cycles partitioned?ResultsWe design a computational model in which a population of individuals evolves to take up nutrients and excrete waste. The waste of one individual is another's resource. Given a fixed amount of resources, this leads to resource cycles. We find that the shortest cycle dominates the ecological dynamics, and over evolutionary time its length is minimized. Initially a single lineage processes a long cycle of resources, later crossfeeding lineages arise. The evolutionary dynamics that follow are determined by the strength of indirect selection for resource cycling. We study indirect selection by changing the spatial setting and the strength of direct selection. If individuals are fixed at lattice sites or direct selection is low, indirect selection result in lineages that structure their local environment, leading to 'smart' individuals and stable patterns of resource dynamics. The individuals are good at cycling resources themselves and do this with a short cycle. On the other hand, if individuals randomly change position each time step, or direct selection is high, individuals are more prone to crossfeeding: an ecosystem based solution with turbulent resource dynamics, and individuals that are less capable of cycling resources themselves.ConclusionIn a baseline model of ecosystem evolution we demonstrate different eco-evolutionary trajectories of resource cycling. By varying the strength of indirect selection through the spatial setting and direct selection, the integration of information by the evolutionary process leads to qualitatively different results from individual smartness to cooperative community structures.},

  abstract  = {A variety of modeling frameworks have been proposed and utilized in complex systems studies, including dynamical systems models that describe state transitions on a system of fixed topology, and self-organizing network models that describe topological transformations of a network with little attention paid to dynamical state changes. Earlier network models typically assumed that topological transformations are caused by exogenous factors, such as preferential attachment of new nodes and stochastic or targeted removal of existing nodes. However, many real-world complex systems exhibit both state transition and topology transformation simultaneously, and they evolve largely autonomously based on the system’s own states and topologies. Here we show that, by using the concept of graph rewriting, both state transitions and autonomous topology transformations of complex systems can be seamlessly integrated and represented in a unified computational framework. We call this novel modeling framework “Generative Network Automata (GNA)”. In this chapter, we introduce basic concepts of GNA, its working definition, its generality to represent other dynamical systems models, and some of our latest results of extensive computational experiments that exhaustively swept over possible rewriting rules of simple binary-state GNA. The results revealed several distinct types of the GNA dynamics.},

Therefore, some techniques to elucidate the material and tissue interactions are mentioned. Bone development, the various types of bone, and bone fracture healing are presented. Thin CaP coatings of implant material can be investigated in in vitro test systems using primary cells or cell lines in culture. More reliable results can be expected from in vivo investigations with animal models. Important results of such investigations are presented. The prediction of the clinical performance of thin CaP coatings on the basis of in vitro and in vivo models is limited.

In this model, execution proceeds by chemical reactions that modify virtual molecules carrying code and data. Self-repair is achieved by what we call autocatalytic quines: programs that permanently reproduce their own code base. The concentration of instructions reflects the health of the system, and is kept stable by the instructions themselves. We show how the chemistry of such programs enables them to withstand arbitrary amounts of random code and data deletion, without affecting the results of their computations.},

First, a metaphor of a chemical reactor (chemostat) is considered. It contains molecules that are represented by binary strings, the strings being capable of replication with a probability proportional to their fitness. Moreover, the process of replication is not fully precise, sporadic mutations may produce new offspring strings, which are slightly different from their parent templates. In the framework of this approach we postulate a folding of binary strings into a secondary 2D structure. The proposed chemostat method offers a detailed view of mechanisms of the molecular Darwinian evolution, in particular of the meaning and importance of neutral mutations. Second, a simplified formal system Typogenetics, introduced by Hofstadter, is discussed. Concepts of replicators and hypercycles, defined within Typogenetics, belong to the basic entities in current perception of artificial life. A metaphor of chemical reactions is applied to study an emergence of replicators and hypercycles.},

A virtual chemical reactor stochastically chooses which reactions should occur and when. Code and data may be rewritten in the process, leading to a system that constantly modifies itself. In order to be closer to chemistry, PlasmidPL relies solely on the data and code stored in molecules.After describing the language, we show some hand-written sample programs that implement initial program generation, mutation and crossover within self-modifying chemical programs. These programs are then used to solve a typical symbolic regression problem, as a feasibility study.

  abstract  = {This paper adopts an interdisciplinary view of the significant elements of ecosystems and the methods by which these might be simulated to explore theoretical issues of relevance to Artificial Life and Ecology. Artificial Life has largely been concerned with evolutionary ecosystems of agents in trivial environments. Ecology commonly produces models of specific habitats and organism populations unsuited to general exploration of theoretical issues. We propose that limitations of the simulations in these disciplines can be overcome by simulating ecosystems from the level of artificial chemistry. We demonstrate the approach’s feasibility by describing several virtual organisms represented at this level. The organisms automatically adopt trophic levels, generate energy from chemical bonds and transform material elements in the process. Virtual organisms may interact with one another and their abiotic environment using the same chemistry. Biosynthesis and decay may also be simulated through this mechanism.},

  abstract  = {Complex dynamical reaction networks consisting of many molecular species are difficult to understand, especially, when new species may appear and present species may vanish completely. This chapter outlines a technique to deal with such systems. The first part introduces the concept of a chemical organisation as a closed and self-maintaining set of molecular species. This concept allows to map a complex (reaction) network to its set of organisations, providing a new view on the system’s structure. The second part connects dynamics with the set of organisations, which allows to map a movement of the system in state space to a movement in the set of organisations. The relevancy of this approach is underlined by a theorem that says that given a differential equation describing the chemical dynamics of the network, then every stationary state is an instance of an organisation. Finally, the relation between pathways and chemical organisations is sketched},

  abstract  = {A recently developed and presented stochastic simulation platform (‘ENVIRONMENT’ [12, 25]), which extends Gillespie’s algorithm for chemically reacting, fixed-volume, homogeneous systems to volume-changing and globally heterogeneous conditions, is applied to investigate the dynamic behaviour of self-(re-)producing vesicles whose membrane consists of both lipids and small peptides. We claim that it is through the integration of these two types of relatively simple –and prebiotically plausible– components that protocells could start their development into functional supramolecular structures, allowing the formation of increasingly complex reaction networks in their internal aqueous milieu. The model is not spatially explicit, but takes into account quite realistically volume-surface constraints, osmotic pressure, diffusion/transport processes, structural elasticity ... In this framework the time evolution of non-equilibrium proto-metabolic cellular systems is studied, paying special attention to the capacity of the system to get rid of its waste material, which proved critical for balanced cell growth (avoiding the risk of an osmotic burst). We also investigate the effects of including an explicit feedback mechanism in the system: the case in which waste transport mediated by peptide chains takes place only under osmotic stress conditions.},

Here we introduce a method that allows to observe the dynamics of a diverse spatial reaction system at different spatial scales. Using chemical organization theory we define for a given spatial location its so called spatial organization, which is the organization generated by the molecular species present in the neighborhood of this location. The scale determines the size of that neighborhood. We show that at one scale, patterns become visible that can not be seen at a different scale. Furthermore, different scales tend to map to different parts of the lattice of organizations; at small scales spatial organizations tend to be small (lower part of the lattice of organizations) while at large scales spatial organizations tend to be large (upper part of the lattice of organizations). Finally we show how the right scale can be selected by comparing the spatial reactor with its well-stirred counterpart. The method is illustrated using an artificial chemistry.},

Can such a system evolve interesting behaviors, thus allowing it to adapt to a wide range of environments? This paper presents a design for such a replicator constructed exclusively from synthetic DNA. The basis for the replicator is crystal growth: information is stored in the spatial arrangement of monomers and copied from layer to layer by templating. Replication is achieved by fragmentation of crystals, which produces new crystals that carry the same information. Crystal replication avoids intrinsic problems associated with template-directed mechanisms for replication of one-dimensional polymers. A key innovation of our work is that by using programmable DNA tiles as the crystal monomers, we can design crystal growth processes that apply interesting selective pressures to the evolving sequences. While evolution requires that copying occur with high accuracy, we show how to adapt error-correction techniques from algorithmic self-assembly to lower the replication error rate as much as is required.},

The main point of the present paper is that very early in the evolution of life, molecular ensembles with high complexity may have arisen, which are best described and analyzed by the tools of Systems Biology. We show that modeled prebiotic mutually catalytic pathways have network attributes similar to those of present-day living cells. This includes network motifs and robustness attributes. We point out that early networks are weighted (graded), but that using a cutoff formalism one may probe their degree distribution and show that it approximate that of a random network. A question is then posed regarding the potential evolutionary mechanisms that may have led to the emergence of scale-free networks in modern cells.},

The paper focuses on the latter, called artificial chemical computing, and discusses several aspects of how the metaphor of chemistry can be employed to build technical information processing systems. In these systems, computation emerges out of an interplay of many decentralized relatively simple components analogized to molecules. Chemical programming encompassed then the definition of molecules, reaction rules, and the topology and dynamics of the reaction space. Due to the self-organizing nature of chemical dynamics, new programming methods are required. Potential approaches for chemical programming are discussed and a road map for developing chemical computing into a unifying and well grounded approach is sketched.},

  abstract  = {Through evolution, biomolecules have resolved fundamental problems as a highly interactive parallel and distributed system that we are just beginning to decipher. Biomolecular Computing (BMC) protocols, however, are unreliable, inefficient and unscalable when compared to computational algorithms run in silico. An alternative approach is explored to exploiting these properties by building biomolecular analogs (eDNA) and virtual test tubes in electronics that would capture the best of both worlds. A distributed implementation is described of a virtual tube, Edna, on a cluster of PCs that does capture the massive asynchronous parallel interactions typical of BMC. Results are reported from over 1000 experiments that calibrate and benchmark Edna's performance, reproduce and extend Adleman's solution to the Hamiltonian Path problem for larger families of graphs than has been possible on a single processor or has been actually carried out in wet labs, and benchmark the feasibility and performance of DNA-based associative memories. The results required a million-fold less molecules and are at least as reliable as in vitro experiments, and so provide strong evidence that the paradigm of molecular computing can be implemented much more efficiently (in terms of time, cost, and probability of success) in silico than the corresponding wet experiments, at least in the range where Edna can be practically run. This approach also demonstrates intrinsic advantages in using electronic analogs of DNA as genomes for genetic algorithms and evolutionary computation.},

The results demonstrate the emergence of dynamic three-dimensional cellular structures from a “primordial soup”, and a variety of self-maintaining structures may be observed, depending on initial conditions.},

  abstract  = {The propagation of text expressed in an n-letter alphabet, An, may be effected by any of the set of associated permutations Sn, applied repeatedly or in suitable combinations until the original text is reproduced. Scaling as n!, the number of possible permutations rapidly becomes intractable, and individual permutations cannot be considered for all but the smallest alphabets. This paper explores how a molecular medium, in which replication must proceed by means of template propagation, might serve to limit the number of permutations which may be reasonably find a molecular expression. The analysis suggests that the number of molecularly realisable permutations is restricted to a limited variety of permutation types, scaling linearly with alphabet size. It is also suggested that alphabets with odd numbers of letters may be less accessible than alphabets with even numbers of letters.},

The loops interact competitively with each other, from which a hypercycle-like network emerges. A spiral structure is seen to emerge from this model with five species. This spiral allows the formation of larger loops at the bounaries between different species. Unlike the single species case, our model allows larger loops to live for long periods of time, and they can replicate in spite of their necessarily lower replication speed.},

Despite its importance to many phenomena, self-replication has not been consistently defined or quantified in a rigorous, universal way. In this paper we propose a universal, continuously valued property of the interaction between a system and its environment. This property represents the effect of the presence of such a system upon the future presence of similar systems. We demonstrate both analytical and computational analysis of self-replicability factors for three distinct systems involving both discrete and continuous behaviors.},

First, the Tierra instruction set is converted into a set of string rewriting rules using regular expressions. Second, every agent is composed of a string as the genome and a set of string rewriting rules as its own instruction set. Third, a genetic operation and selection of rewriting rules are introduced to allow the agents to weed out the worst rules. We carried out experiments on how agents evolve through self-replication. The results have shown that our system can evolve not only the agents’ genomes but also the rewriting rule sets.},

It can be defined by (1) a set of objects (a chemostat composed of molecules) and (2) a set of transformation rules (chemical reactions), which specify how the objects are transformed into other objects. The purpose of the present short communication is to use the well-known Eigen’s chemical system of replicators as a new (chemical) metaphor. It is then applied in design of the so-called replicator algorithm. This algorithm has some common features with genetic algorithms, but as an advantage of the presented replicator algorithm we consider an existence of relatively simple proof that the algorithm offers globally optimal solutions.},

Platforms designed for studying the origin of life are based on a world of simple rules and simple objects, capable of producing complex organisms. But such worlds are not suitable for cognitive studies focused on complex behaviors, because they are too slow for emergence and simulation of such behaviors. A platform called Zamin is presented, which is believed to be fast, expandable, realistic, and suitable for cognitive simulations aimed to study the emergence of complex behaviors.},

It demonstrates that proto-cell structures that maintain and reproduce themselves autonomously emerge from a non-organized initial configuration. The results also suggest that a metabolic system that produces membranes can be selected in the chemical evolution of a pre-cellular stage.},

It was introduced by Hofstadter in his book Dialogues with Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid [17]. Autoreplicating molecules and systems of mutually replicating and catalyzing molecules (hypercycles) were modeled in the present paper in a very simplified way. Abstracted molecules in a form of strands are used in a model of a vessel, where “chemical reactions” occur. The approach is very similar to evolutionary algorithms. While a small hypercycle of two molecules mutually supporting their reproduction can be created without extreme difficulties, it is nearly impossible to create a hypercycle involving more than 4 autoreplicators at once. This paper demonstrates, that larger hypercycles can be created by an optimization and inclusion of new molecules into a smaller hypercycle. Such a sequential construction of hypercycles can substantially reduce the combinatorial complexity in comparison with a simultaneous optimization of single components of a large hypercycle.},

The phases they pass through and their stability with respect to an external influx of random information are examined. We notice that no organisation seems to be totally stable over time, yet metabolic organisations pass through a growth phase with a much higher stability. Lastly we observe how the different phases are triggered by the presence or absence of particular atoms.},
