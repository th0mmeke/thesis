  abstract  = {The open-endedness of a system is often defined as a continual production of novelty. Here we pin down this concept more fully by defining several types of novelty that a system may exhibit, classified as variation, innovation, and emergence. We then provide a meta-model for including levels of structure in a system’s model. From there, we define an architecture suitable for building simulations of open-ended novelty-generating systems and discuss how previously proposed systems fit into this framework. We discuss the design principles applicable to those systems and close with some challenges for the community.},

  abstract  = {RNA molecules have served for decades as a paradigmatic example of molecular evolution that is tractable both in in vitro experiments and in detailed computer simulation. The adaptation of RNA sequences to external selection pressures is well studied and well understood. The de novo innovation or optimization of RNA aptamers and riboswitches in SELEX experiments serves as a case in point. Likewise, fitness landscapes building upon the efficiently computable RNA secondary structures have been a key toward understanding realistic fitness landscapes. Much less is known, however, on models in which multiple RNAs interact with each other, thus actively influencing the selection pressures acting on them. From a computational perspective, RNA–RNA interactions can be dealt with by same basic methods as the folding of a single RNA molecule, although many details become more complicated. RNA–RNA interactions are frequently employed in cellular regulation networks, e.g., as miRNA bases mRNA silencing or in the modulation of bacterial mRNAs by small, often highly structured sRNAs. In this chapter, we summarize the key features of networks of replicators. We highlight the differences between quasispecies-like models describing templates copied by an external replicase and hypercycle similar to autocatalytic replicators. Two aspects are of importance: the dynamics of selection within a population, usually described by conventional dynamical systems, and the evolution of replicating species in the space of chemical types. Product inhibition plays a key role in modulating selection dynamics from survival of the fittest to extinction of unfittest. The sequence evolution of replicators is rather well understood as approximate optimization in a fitness landscape for templates that is shaped by the sequence-structure map of RNA. Some of the properties of this map, in particular shape space covering and extensive neutral networks, give rise to evolutionary patterns such as drift-like motion in sequence space, akin to the behavior of RNA quasispecies. In contrast, very little is known about the influence of sequence-structure maps on autocatalytic replication systems.},

Using artificial chemistry as a starting point to simulate life is a promising way to limit the possibilities because chemical reactions are always the same under the same physical conditions. We have built an 3D artificial chemistry system simulating molecules and the reactions among them. Our goal is to simulate a cell or a group of cells in the future using mainly molecules and chemical reactions. In this paper, we show that the system can simulate the fundamental aspects of reproduction, metabolism and adaptation in cells. This is accomplished by simulating reproducing molecules, reactions which provide energy to the reproducing molecules and the adaptation ability of reproducing molecules.},

  abstract  = {The emergence of autocatalytic sets of molecules seems to have played an important role in the origin of life context. Although the possibility to reproduce this emergence in laboratory has received considerable attention, this is still far from being achieved.In order to unravel some key properties enabling the emergence of structures potentially able to sustain their own existence and growth, in this work we investigate the probability to observe them in ensembles of random catalytic reaction networks characterized by different structural properties.From the point of view of network topology, an autocatalytic set have been defined either in term of strongly connected components (SCCs) or as reflexively autocatalytic and food-generated sets (RAFs).We observe that the average level of catalysis differently affects the probability to observe a SCC or a RAF, highlighting the existence of a region where the former can be observed, whereas the latter cannot. This parameter also affects the composition of the RAF, which can be further characterized into linear structures, autocatalysis or SCCs.Interestingly, we show that the different network topology (uniform as opposed to power-law catalysis systems) does not have a significantly divergent impact on SCCs and RAFs appearance, whereas the proportion between cleavages and condensations seems instead to play a role.A major factor that limits the probability of RAF appearance and that may explain some of the difficulties encountered in laboratory seems to be the presence of molecules which can accumulate without being substrate or catalyst of any reaction.},

Recent scientific and technical developments make it possible to make the transition from passively understanding to actively using evolutionary processes. Today this is possible in Evolutionary Computing, where human experimenters can design and manipulate all components of evolutionary processes in digital spaces. We argue that in the near future it will be possible to implement artificial evolutionary processes outside such imaginary spaces and make them physically embodied. In other words, we envision the “Evolution of Things”, rather than just the evolution of digital objects, leading to a new field of Embodied Artificial Evolution (EAE). The main objective of this paper is to present a unifying vision in order to aid the development of this high potential research area. To this end, we introduce the notion of EAE, discuss a few examples and applications, and elaborate on the expected benefits as well as the grand challenges this developing field will have to address.},

This paper presents a minimal model based on the physical movement of particles for investigating the relationship between the behavior of the hosts (velocity of particles) and the autocatalytic property of the meme. It is demonstrated that two extreme memes, the fastest and the slowest ones, have a strong tendency to survive by autocatalytic properties at individual and aggregate levels, respectively, although all memes seem neutral in terms of fitness in the model definition.},

  abstract  = {The paper presents a model of coevolution of short peptides (P) and short oligonucleotides (N) at an early stage of chemical evolution leading to the origin of life. The model describes polymerization of both P and N types of molecules on mineral surfaces in aqueous solution at moderate temperatures. It is assumed that amino acid and nucleotide monomers were available in a prebiotic milieu, that periodic variation in environmental conditions between dry/warm and wet/cool took place and that energy sources were available for the polymerization. An artificial chemistry approach in combination with agent-based modeling was used to explore chemical evolution from an initially random mixture of monomers. It was assumed that the oligonucleotides could serve as templates for self-replication and for translation of peptide compositional sequences, and that certain peptides could serve as weak catalysts. Important features of the model are the short lengths of the peptide and oligonucleotide molecules that prevent an error catastrophe caused by copying errors and a finite diffusion rate of the molecules on a mineral surface that prevents excessive development of parasitism. The result of the simulation was the emergence of self-replicating molecular systems consisting of peptide catalysts and oligonucleotide templates. In addition, a smaller but significant number of molecules with alternative compositions also survived due to imprecise reproduction and translation of templates providing variability for further evolution. In a more general context, the model describes not only peptide-oligonucleotide molecular systems, but any molecular system containing two types of polymer molecules: one of which serves as templates and the other as catalysts.The presented coevolutionary system suggests a possible direction towards finding the origin of molecular functionality in a prebiotic environment.},

Based on this discussion, we move on to evaluate typical artificial chemistry systems: We propose 13 conditions necessary for emergent evolution and three topological conditions that must be met by the rules for transport of symbols. We also introduce the concept of a molecular network, which emulates the spatial relationship of the molecules. With hard-sphere random-walk simulations, we show seven topological conditions that the molecular network must satisfy. In the latter half of this chapter, we feature the example of network artificial chemistry (NAC), in which a molecular network is used for spatial representation, and present some of the research results derived since this was first proposed. We begin by introducing a model wherein a cluster formed by folding a node chain functions as an active machine. We then overview studies on rewiring rules for weak edges, which form the basis for network dynamics. We discuss the merits and demerits of the method expressing spatial constraints derived from the network energy, then introduce models devised to circumvent the difficulties: a model that implements active functions (programs) in the nodes and an improved model that implements the programs in agents to allow them to move within the network. The improved model, called “program-flow computing,” is expected to be refined into a new computing model.},

Instruction-set based Artifical Life has appropriate evolutionary properties, but the individual is represented as a single executing sequence with little additional physiology. We describe a novel combination of stochastic chemistries and evolvable molecule microprograms that gives a rich evolutionary framework. A single organism is represented by a set of exectuing sequences. Key to this approach is the use of inexact sequence matching for binding between individual molecules and for branching of molecular microprograms.

Since John Von Neumann and Alan Turing pioneering works on self-replication and morphogenesis, proponents of artificial life have chosen to resolutely neglecting a lot of materialistic and quantitative information deemed not indispensable and have focused on the rule-based mechanisms making life possible, supposedly neutral with respect to their underlying material embodiment. Minimal life begins at the intersection of a series of processes which need to be isolated, differentiated and duplicated as such in computers. Only software developments and running make possible to understand the way these processes are intimately interconnected in order for life to appear at the crossroad. In this paper, I will attempt to set out the history of life as the disciples of artificial life understand it, by placing these different lessons on a temporal and causal axis, showing which one is indispensable to the appearance of the next and how does it connect to the next. I will discuss the task of artificial life as setting up experimental software platforms where these different lessons, whether taken in isolation or together, are tested, simulated, and, more systematically, analyzed. I will sketch some of these existing software platforms: chemical reaction networks, Varela’s autopoietic cellular automata, Ganti’s chemoton model, whose running delivers interesting take home messages to open-minded biologists.},

  abstract  = {The Graded Autocatalysis Replication Domain (GARD) model describes an origin of life scenario which involves non-covalent compositional assemblies, made of monomeric mutually catalytic molecules. GARD constitutes an alternative to informational biopolymers as a mechanism of primordial inheritance. In the present work, we examined the effect of mutations, one of the most fundamental mechanisms for evolution, in the context of the networks of mutual interaction within GARD prebiotic assemblies. We performed a systematic analysis analogous to single and double gene deletions within GARD. While most deletions have only a small effect on both growth rate and molecular composition of the assemblies, ~10% of the deletions caused lethality, or sometimes showed enhanced fitness. Analysis of 14 different network properties on 2,000 different GARD networks indicated that lethality usually takes place when the deleted node has a high molecular count, or when it is a catalyst for such node. A correlation was also found between lethality and node degree centrality, similar to what is seen in real biological networks. Addressing double knockout mutations, our results demonstrate the occurrence of both synthetic lethality and extragenic suppression within GARD networks, and convey an attempt to correlate synthetic lethality to network node-pair properties. The analyses presented help establish GARD as a workable alternative prebiotic scenario, suggesting that life may have begun with large molecular networks of low fidelity, that later underwent evolutionary compaction and fidelity augmentation.},

An artificial-life application is designed as a modification of the metaphor of chemical reactor (chemostat), where the secondary structure of binary strings (RNA-like molecules) specifies instructions for replication of binary strings. It means that a molecular phenotype is interpreted as a computer program for an artificial-life system. Properties of such a system unambiguously demonstrate its capability to model quick evolutionary emergence of replicators — programs that are able of quick and complete replication.},

  abstract  = {Two simplified models of Darwinian evolution at the molecular level are studied by applying the methods of artificial chemistry. First, a metaphor of a chemical reactor (chemostat) is considered. It contains molecules that are represented by binary strings, the strings being capable of replication with a probability proportional to their fitness. Moreover, the process of replication is not fully precise, sporadic mutations may produce new offspring strings, which are slightly different from their parent templates. In the framework of this approach we postulate a folding of binary strings into a secondary 2D structure. The proposed chemostat method offers a detailed view of mechanisms of the molecular Darwinian evolution, in particular of the meaning and importance of neutral mutations. Second, a simplified formal system Typogenetics, introduced by Hofstadter, is discussed. Concepts of replicators and hypercycles, defined within Typogenetics, belong to the basic entities in current perception of artificial life. A metaphor of chemical reactions is applied to study an emergence of replicators and hypercycles.},

We briefly describe the extension of this model to incorporate a higher, protocell, level of selection. We show that the interaction between the two levels of selection then serves to control parasitic exploitation at the molecular level, while still significantly constraining accessible evolutionary trajectories at the protocell level. We conclude with a brief discussion of the implications for further work.},

Using chemical organization theory we define for a given spatial location its so called spatial organization, which is the organization generated by the molecular species present in the neighborhood of this location. The scale determines the size of that neighborhood. We show that at one scale, patterns become visible that can not be seen at a different scale. Furthermore, different scales tend to map to different parts of the lattice of organizations; at small scales spatial organizations tend to be small (lower part of the lattice of organizations) while at large scales spatial organizations tend to be large (upper part of the lattice of organizations). Finally we show how the right scale can be selected by comparing the spatial reactor with its well-stirred counterpart. The method is illustrated using an artificial chemistry.},

We show that conditions for such growth are in principle satisfied by universal constructors, yet that in practice much simpler replicators may satisfy scaled-down – yet equally relevant – versions thereof. Examples of such evolvable self-replicators are described and discussed, and future challenges identified.},

  abstract  = {Through evolution, biomolecules have resolved fundamental problems as a highly interactive parallel and distributed system that we are just beginning to decipher. Biomolecular Computing (BMC) protocols, however, are unreliable, inefficient and unscalable when compared to computational algorithms run in silico. An alternative approach is explored to exploiting these properties by building biomolecular analogs (eDNA) and virtual test tubes in electronics that would capture the best of both worlds. A distributed implementation is described of a virtual tube, Edna, on a cluster of PCs that does capture the massive asynchronous parallel interactions typical of BMC. Results are reported from over 1000 experiments that calibrate and benchmark Edna's performance, reproduce and extend Adleman's solution to the Hamiltonian Path problem for larger families of graphs than has been possible on a single processor or has been actually carried out in wet labs, and benchmark the feasibility and performance of DNA-based associative memories. The results required a million-fold less molecules and are at least as reliable as in vitro experiments, and so provide strong evidence that the paradigm of molecular computing can be implemented much more efficiently (in terms of time, cost, and probability of success) in silico than the corresponding wet experiments, at least in the range where Edna can be practically run. This approach also demonstrates intrinsic advantages in using electronic analogs of DNA as genomes for genetic algorithms and evolutionary computation.},

It was introduced by Hofstadter in his book Dialogues with Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid [17]. Autoreplicating molecules and systems of mutually replicating and catalyzing molecules (hypercycles) were modeled in the present paper in a very simplified way. Abstracted molecules in a form of strands are used in a model of a vessel, where “chemical reactions” occur. The approach is very similar to evolutionary algorithms. While a small hypercycle of two molecules mutually supporting their reproduction can be created without extreme difficulties, it is nearly impossible to create a hypercycle involving more than 4 autoreplicators at once. This paper demonstrates, that larger hypercycles can be created by an optimization and inclusion of new molecules into a smaller hypercycle. Such a sequential construction of hypercycles can substantially reduce the combinatorial complexity in comparison with a simultaneous optimization of single components of a large hypercycle.},
