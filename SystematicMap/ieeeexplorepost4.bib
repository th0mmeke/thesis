abstract={We present a novel unit of evolution: a self-reproducing cell in a two-dimensional artificial chemistry. The cells have a strip of genetic material that is used to produce enzymes, each catalyzing a specific reaction that may affect the survival of the cell. The enzymes are kept inside the cell by a loop of membrane, thus ensuring that only the cell that produced them gets their benefit. A set of reaction rules, each simple and local, allows the cells to copy their genetic information and physically divide. The evolutionary possibilities of the cells are explored, and it is suggested that the system provides a useful framework for testing hypotheses about self-driven evolution.},

abstract={A simple artificial chemistry for the Squirm3 artificial environment, consisting of replicators that produce quasi-universal enzymes, is presented. The aim of this system is twofold: first, to demonstrate the survival of extracellular replicators despite the presence of faster-replicating parasites; second, to observe the evolution of adaptively useful enzymes. Accomplishing these goals will underpin future attempts to attain open-ended and/or creative evolution in the Squirm3 environment. The first aim is achieved by attaching enzymes to their replicators. Our software implementation demonstrates replicators with 10 bases prospering in the presence of parasites with zero bases. To accomplish the second aim, a process for creating selection pressure toward longer molecules is introduced. The evolution and subsequent dominance of a replicator that produces an adaptively useful enzyme is demonstrated experimentally. Finally, we comment on the crucial role played by neutral evolution and discuss the biological significance of our results.},

abstract={We show how it is possible to make a self-reproducing cell in an artificial chemistry by surrounding a replicating molecule with a semi-permeable membrane. The molecule can carry an arbitrary amount of information, encoded in a material form as a sequence of bases, as in DNA. The cells produce enzymes through a decoding of their base sequence, and these enzymes trigger reactions essential to the cell's survival. Earlier work in a similar artificial chemistry showed that replicators free in solution could obtain no survival advantage from producing enzymes; here we show that when surrounded by a membrane the replicators can obtain an advantage. We show that the cells reliably reproduce over many generations under environmental pressure for resources. By creating cells in a material-based artificial chemistry we hope that the system might have the potential for open-ended, creative evolution.},
