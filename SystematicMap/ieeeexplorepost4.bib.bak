abstract={Why do we create neural networks that have no chemistry? Why simulate genetics without a digestive system? There is no such thing as half an organism, yet most attempts to generate intelligent or life-like agents are based essentially on a single mechanism. Granted, a few people are working on evolvable neural networks, but the genetics is seen as a means to an end, rather than a part of an integrated, heterogeneous system. Neural networks themselves are generally homogeneous entities, too-one kind of neuron, interconnected in one or at most a few different ways and performing a single task. Yet, we know that our brains are not like that at all: they are divided into regions that perform many different tasks and contain populations of very different cells. What is more, artificial neural networks generally employ only direct synaptic connections for their signal paths, despite our awareness that real brains are swimming in neurotransmitters that have diffuse and plural functions. Taking a holistic approach and attempting to create such a “whole” organism might sound like a brave or even foolhardy task. However, in this article, I explore the possibilities and see what could be done},

abstract={This paper describes implementation details and results from a simulated multi-agent bacteria ecosystem. Each bacterium is encoded on a DNA-like genome which is interpreted to specify the gene binding sites and protein production rules. Protein and gene compounds interact in an artificial chemistry, producing regulatory networks and observable behaviours such as moving, splitting and eating. Through genome inheritance and mutation, a virtual bacteria culture evolves.},

abstract={We present a novel unit of evolution: a self-reproducing cell in a two-dimensional artificial chemistry. The cells have a strip of genetic material that is used to produce enzymes, each catalyzing a specific reaction that may affect the survival of the cell. The enzymes are kept inside the cell by a loop of membrane, thus ensuring that only the cell that produced them gets their benefit. A set of reaction rules, each simple and local, allows the cells to copy their genetic information and physically divide. The evolutionary possibilities of the cells are explored, and it is suggested that the system provides a useful framework for testing hypotheses about self-driven evolution.},

abstract={A simple artificial chemistry for the Squirm3 artificial environment, consisting of replicators that produce quasi-universal enzymes, is presented. The aim of this system is twofold: first, to demonstrate the survival of extracellular replicators despite the presence of faster-replicating parasites; second, to observe the evolution of adaptively useful enzymes. Accomplishing these goals will underpin future attempts to attain open-ended and/or creative evolution in the Squirm3 environment. The first aim is achieved by attaching enzymes to their replicators. Our software implementation demonstrates replicators with 10 bases prospering in the presence of parasites with zero bases. To accomplish the second aim, a process for creating selection pressure toward longer molecules is introduced. The evolution and subsequent dominance of a replicator that produces an adaptively useful enzyme is demonstrated experimentally. Finally, we comment on the crucial role played by neutral evolution and discuss the biological significance of our results.},

The author's credo is pure reductionism, i.e., the view that the work of the neural system can be completely explained in terms of chemistry, physics, and mathematics, and that it can also be reproduced in artificial systems. A structural and information approach to neural systems analysis is discussed},

abstract={We show how it is possible to make a self-reproducing cell in an artificial chemistry by surrounding a replicating molecule with a semi-permeable membrane. The molecule can carry an arbitrary amount of information, encoded in a material form as a sequence of bases, as in DNA. The cells produce enzymes through a decoding of their base sequence, and these enzymes trigger reactions essential to the cell's survival. Earlier work in a similar artificial chemistry showed that replicators free in solution could obtain no survival advantage from producing enzymes; here we show that when surrounded by a membrane the replicators can obtain an advantage. We show that the cells reliably reproduce over many generations under environmental pressure for resources. By creating cells in a material-based artificial chemistry we hope that the system might have the potential for open-ended, creative evolution.},
