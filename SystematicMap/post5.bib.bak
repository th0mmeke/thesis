  abstract = {{A simple artificial chemistry for the Squirm3 artificial environment,
   consisting of replicators that produce quasi-universal enzymes, is
   presented. The aim of this system is twofold: first, to demonstrate the
   survival of extracellular replicators despite the presence of
   faster-replicating parasites; second, to observe the evolution of
   adaptively useful enzymes. Accomplishing these goals will underpin
   future attempts to attain open-ended and/or creative evolution in the
   Squirm3 environment. The first aim is achieved by attaching enzymes to
   their replicators. Our software implementation demonstrates replicators
   with 10 bases prospering in the presence of parasites with zero bases.
   To accomplish the second aim, a process for creating selection pressure
   toward longer molecules is introduced. The evolution and subsequent
   dominance of a replicator that produces an adaptively useful enzyme is
   demonstrated experimentally. Finally, we comment on the crucial role
   played by neutral evolution and discuss the biological significance of
   our results.}},

  abstract = {{The paper presents a model of coevolution of short peptides (P) and
   short oligonucleotides (N) at an early stage of chemical evolution
   leading to the origin of life. The model describes polymerization of
   both P and N types of molecules on mineral surfaces in aqueous solution
   at moderate temperatures. It is assumed that amino acid and nucleotide
   monomers were available in a prebiotic milieu, that periodic variation
   in environmental conditions between dry/warm and wet/cool took place and
   that energy sources were available for the polymerization. An artificial
   chemistry approach in combination with agent-based modeling was used to
   explore chemical evolution from an initially random mixture of monomers.
   It was assumed that the oligonucleotides could serve as templates for
   self-replication and for translation of peptide compositional sequences,
   and that certain peptides could serve as weak catalysts. Important
   features of the model are the short lengths of the peptide and
   oligonucleotide molecules that prevent an error catastrophe caused by
   copying errors and a finite diffusion rate of the molecules on a mineral
   surface that prevents excessive development of parasitism. The result of
   the simulation was the emergence of self-replicating molecular systems
   consisting of peptide catalysts and oligonucleotide templates. In
   addition, a smaller but significant number of molecules with alternative
   compositions also survived due to imprecise reproduction and translation
   of templates providing variability for further evolution. In a more
   general context, the model describes not only peptide-oligonucleotide
   molecular systems, but any molecular system containing two types of
   polymer molecules: one of which serves as templates and the other as
   catalysts.The presented coevolutionary system suggests a possible
   direction towards finding the origin of molecular functionality in a
   prebiotic environment.}},

   increases due to the energetic demands of growth, but also of memory,

   survive in a wider range of environments. We investigated the evolution

   transition within the origins-of-life and artificial life communities,
   and more recently alternative pictures have been emerging from advances
   in nanoscience and biotechnology. The proposed proto-organism lends
   itself to both traditions and defines a new picture based on a simple
   idea: Given a set of required functionalities, minimize the
   physicochemical structures that support these functionalities, and make
   sure that all Structures self-assemble and Mutually enhance each other's
   existence. The result is the first concrete, rational design of a simple
   physicochemical system that integrates the key functionalities in a
   thermodynamically favorable manner as a lipid aggregate integrates
   proto-genes and a proto-metabolisin. Under external pumping of free
   energy, the metabolic processes produce the required building blocks,
   and only specific gene sequences enhance the metabolic kinetics
   sufficiently for the whole system to survive. We propose an experimental
   implementation of the proto-organism with a discussion of our
   experimental results, together with relevant results produced by other
   experimental groups, and we specify what is still missing
   experimentally. Identifying the missing steps is just as important as
   providing the road map for the transition. We derive the kinetic and
   thermodynamic conditions of each of the proto-organism subsystems
   together with relevant theoretical and computational results about these
   subsystems. We present and discuss detailed 3D simulations of the lipid
   aggregation processes. From the reaction kinetics we derive analytical
   aggregate size distributions, and derive key properties of the metabolic
   efficiency and stability. Thermodynamics and kinetics of the ligation
   directed self-replication of the proto-genes is discussed, and we
   summarize the full life cycle of the proto-organism by comparing size,
   replication time, and energy with the biomass efficiency of contemporary
   unicells. Finally, we also compare our proto-organism picture with
   existing origins-of-life and protocell pictures.

   to evolve from molecular to cellular reproduction. In this report, we
   present a model of artificial chemistry that simulates metabolic
   reactions, diffusion and repulsion of abstract chemicals in a
   two-dimensional space to realize the organization of proto-cell
   structures. It demonstrates that proto-cell structures that maintain and

  abstract  = {We show how it is possible to make a self-reproducing cell in an artificial chemistry by surrounding a replicating molecule with a semi-permeable membrane. The molecule can carry an arbitrary amount of information, encoded in a material form as a sequence of bases, as in DNA. The cells produce enzymes through a decoding of their base sequence, and these enzymes trigger reactions essential to the cell's survival. Earlier work in a similar artificial chemistry showed that replicators free in solution could obtain no survival advantage from producing enzymes; here we show that when surrounded by a membrane the replicators can obtain an advantage. We show that the cells reliably reproduce over many generations under environmental pressure for resources. By creating cells in a material-based artificial chemistry we hope that the system might have the potential for open-ended, creative evolution.},

A key question for metabolism first theories is the mechanism for transfer of inherited information. Earlier work presented a mechanism based on catalytic cycles, along with supporting results from the SimSoup artificial chemistry simulator. The current paper presents an enhanced SimSoup model that is closer to real chemistry and more open ended. Molecules and the types of Interactions between them are constructed by the model itself using simple rules based on valence theory. Results of a preliminary run of the model are presented. Most of the Molecules produced are of a few simple types with low molecular weight. There is a ‘long tail’ of many low frequency Molecules, many of which are more complex with high molecular weight.},

  abstract   = {Automata chemistries are good vehicles for experimentation in open-ended evolution, but they are by necessity complex systems whose low-level properties require careful design. To aid the process of designing automata chemistries, we develop an abstract model that classifies the features of a chemistry from a physical (bottom up) perspective and from a biological (top down) perspective. There are two levels: things that can evolve, and things that cannot. We equate the evolving level with biology and the non-evolving level with physics. We design our initial organisms in the biology, so they can evolve. We design the physics to facilitate evolvable biologies. This architecture leads to a set of design principles that should be observed when creating an instantiation of the architecture. These principles are Everything Evolves, Everything's Soft, and Everything Dies. To evaluate these ideas, we present experiments in the recently developed Stringmol automata chemistry. We examine the properties of Stringmol with respect to the principles, and so demonstrate the usefulness of the principles in designing automata chemistries.},

Occurring as random events or dedicated physical signals, triggers effect transitions from one subsystem to another which might result in substantial changes of detectable behavior. From a modeling point of view, those subsystems typically differ in their reaction rules or principle of operation. We propose a formulation of trigger-based switching between models from a class of P systems with progression in time employing discretized mass-action kinetics. Two examples inspired by biological phenomena illustrate the consecutive interplay of P systems towards structural plasticity in reaction rules: evolutionary construction of reaction networks and artificial chemistries with self-reproducible subunits.},

  abstract  = {Two simplified models of Darwinian evolution at the molecular level are studied by applying the methods of artificial chemistry. First, a metaphor of a chemical reactor (chemostat) is considered. It contains molecules that are represented by binary strings, the strings being capable of replication with a probability proportional to their fitness. Moreover, the process of replication is not fully precise, sporadic mutations may produce new offspring strings, which are slightly different from their parent templates. In the framework of this approach we postulate a folding of binary strings into a secondary 2D structure. The proposed chemostat method offers a detailed view of mechanisms of the molecular Darwinian evolution, in particular of the meaning and importance of neutral mutations. Second, a simplified formal system Typogenetics, introduced by Hofstadter, is discussed. Concepts of replicators and hypercycles, defined within Typogenetics, belong to the basic entities in current perception of artificial life. A metaphor of chemical reactions is applied to study an emergence of replicators and hypercycles.},

  abstract  = {The emergence of autocatalytic sets of molecules seems to have played an important role in the origin of life context. Although the possibility to reproduce this emergence in laboratory has received considerable attention, this is still far from being achieved.In order to unravel some key properties enabling the emergence of structures potentially able to sustain their own existence and growth, in this work we investigate the probability to observe them in ensembles of random catalytic reaction networks characterized by different structural properties.From the point of view of network topology, an autocatalytic set have been defined either in term of strongly connected components (SCCs) or as reflexively autocatalytic and food-generated sets (RAFs).We observe that the average level of catalysis differently affects the probability to observe a SCC or a RAF, highlighting the existence of a region where the former can be observed, whereas the latter cannot. This parameter also affects the composition of the RAF, which can be further characterized into linear structures, autocatalysis or SCCs.Interestingly, we show that the different network topology (uniform as opposed to power-law catalysis systems) does not have a significantly divergent impact on SCCs and RAFs appearance, whereas the proportion between cleavages and condensations seems instead to play a role.A major factor that limits the probability of RAF appearance and that may explain some of the difficulties encountered in laboratory seems to be the presence of molecules which can accumulate without being substrate or catalyst of any reaction.},

  abstract  = {When we simulate life, there are always more things to simulate than what have been coded. Life is complex and seems to have endless possibilities. Using artificial chemistry as a starting point to simulate life is a promising way to limit the possibilities because chemical reactions are always the same under the same physical conditions. We have built an 3D artificial chemistry system simulating molecules and the reactions among them. Our goal is to simulate a cell or a group of cells in the future using mainly molecules and chemical reactions. In this paper, we show that the system can simulate the fundamental aspects of reproduction, metabolism and adaptation in cells. This is accomplished by simulating reproducing molecules, reactions which provide energy to the reproducing molecules and the adaptation ability of reproducing molecules.},

  abstract  = {Bacteria offer an evolutionary model in which rich interactions between phenotype and genotype lead to compact genomes with efficient metabolic pathways. We seek an analogous computational process that supports a rich artificial heredity. These systems can be simulated by stochastic chemistry models, but there is currently no scope for open-ended evolution of the molecular species that make up the models. Instruction-set based Artifical Life has appropriate evolutionary properties, but the individual is represented as a single executing sequence with little additional physiology. We describe a novel combination of stochastic chemistries and evolvable molecule microprograms that gives a rich evolutionary framework. A single organism is represented by a set of exectuing sequences. Key to this approach is the use of inexact sequence matching for binding between individual molecules and for branching of molecular microprograms. We illustrate the approach by implementation of two steady-state replicase RNA analogues that demonstrate “invasion when rare”.},

We relate recent advances in this field to the concept of the evolutionary growth of complexity, a term introduced by McMullin to describe the central idea contained in von Neumann’s self-reproducing automata theory. We show that conditions for such growth are in principle satisfied by universal constructors, yet that in practice much simpler replicators may satisfy scaled-down – yet equally relevant – versions thereof. Examples of such evolvable self-replicators are described and discussed, and future challenges identified.},

First, the Tierra instruction set is converted into a set of string rewriting rules using regular expressions. Second, every agent is composed of a string as the genome and a set of string rewriting rules as its own instruction set. Third, a genetic operation and selection of rewriting rules are introduced to allow the agents to weed out the worst rules. We carried out experiments on how agents evolve through self-replication. The results have shown that our system can evolve not only the agents’ genomes but also the rewriting rule sets.},

  abstract  = {This chapter focuses on artificial chemistry, a research approach for constructing life-like systems in artificial environments, and presents its fundamental concepts and system design requirements. Based on this discussion, we move on to evaluate typical artificial chemistry systems: We propose 13 conditions necessary for emergent evolution and three topological conditions that must be met by the rules for transport of symbols. We also introduce the concept of a molecular network, which emulates the spatial relationship of the molecules. With hard-sphere random-walk simulations, we show seven topological conditions that the molecular network must satisfy. In the latter half of this chapter, we feature the example of network artificial chemistry (NAC), in which a molecular network is used for spatial representation, and present some of the research results derived since this was first proposed. We begin by introducing a model wherein a cluster formed by folding a node chain functions as an active machine. We then overview studies on rewiring rules for weak edges, which form the basis for network dynamics. We discuss the merits and demerits of the method expressing spatial constraints derived from the network energy, then introduce models devised to circumvent the difficulties: a model that implements active functions (programs) in the nodes and an improved model that implements the programs in agents to allow them to move within the network. The improved model, called “program-flow computing,” is expected to be refined into a new computing model.},
