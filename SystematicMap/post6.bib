  abstract  = {Self-replication is a fundamental property of many interesting physical, formal and biological systems, such as crystals, waves, automata, and especially forms of natural and artificial life. Despite its importance to many phenomena, self-replication has not been consistently defined or quantified in a rigorous, universal way. In this paper we propose a universal, continuously valued property of the interaction between a system and its environment. This property represents the effect of the presence of such a system upon the future presence of similar systems. We demonstrate both analytical and computational analysis of self-replicability factors for three distinct systems involving both discrete and continuous behaviors.},

  abstract  = {Two simplified models of Darwinian evolution at the molecular level are studied by applying the methods of artificial chemistry. First, a metaphor of a chemical reactor (chemostat) is considered. It contains molecules that are represented by binary strings, the strings being capable of replication with a probability proportional to their fitness. Moreover, the process of replication is not fully precise, sporadic mutations may produce new offspring strings, which are slightly different from their parent templates. In the framework of this approach we postulate a folding of binary strings into a secondary 2D structure. The proposed chemostat method offers a detailed view of mechanisms of the molecular Darwinian evolution, in particular of the meaning and importance of neutral mutations. Second, a simplified formal system Typogenetics, introduced by Hofstadter, is discussed. Concepts of replicators and hypercycles, defined within Typogenetics, belong to the basic entities in current perception of artificial life. A metaphor of chemical reactions is applied to study an emergence of replicators and hypercycles.},

  abstract  = {Third simplified model of Darwinian evolution at the molecular level, following the two studied in our previous approach, is studied by applying the methods of artificial chemistry. An artificial-life application is designed as a modification of the metaphor of chemical reactor (chemostat), where the secondary structure of binary strings (RNA-like molecules) specifies instructions for replication of binary strings. It means that a molecular phenotype is interpreted as a computer program for an artificial-life system. Properties of such a system unambiguously demonstrate its capability to model quick evolutionary emergence of replicators — programs that are able of quick and complete replication.},

Self-replication and assembly are emergent properties of such systems. These biomolecular systems have common thematic features that enable them from self-replicating and self-assembling themselves. In this paper, I try to generalize these common thematic features to generate a generalized model of the complement-based self-replicated, self-assembled systems. In this model, I explained the main requirements for achieving these systems in terms of basic system components and how these components interact with each other through self-assembling rule set and complement-based replication rule set generating systems with potential to be self-replicated machines. After generating this model, I have applied this model to DNA and simulated its basics.},

First, the Tierra instruction set is converted into a set of string rewriting rules using regular expressions. Second, every agent is composed of a string as the genome and a set of string rewriting rules as its own instruction set. Third, a genetic operation and selection of rewriting rules are introduced to allow the agents to weed out the worst rules. We carried out experiments on how agents evolve through self-replication. The results have shown that our system can evolve not only the agents’ genomes but also the rewriting rule sets.},

  abstract   = {Automata chemistries are good vehicles for experimentation in open-ended evolution, but they are by necessity complex systems whose low-level properties require careful design. To aid the process of designing automata chemistries, we develop an abstract model that classifies the features of a chemistry from a physical (bottom up) perspective and from a biological (top down) perspective. There are two levels: things that can evolve, and things that cannot. We equate the evolving level with biology and the non-evolving level with physics. We design our initial organisms in the biology, so they can evolve. We design the physics to facilitate evolvable biologies. This architecture leads to a set of design principles that should be observed when creating an instantiation of the architecture. These principles are Everything Evolves, Everything's Soft, and Everything Dies. To evaluate these ideas, we present experiments in the recently developed Stringmol automata chemistry. We examine the properties of Stringmol with respect to the principles, and so demonstrate the usefulness of the principles in designing automata chemistries.},

  abstract  = {Complex reaction systems in molecular biology are often composed of partially independent subsystems associated with the activity of external or internal triggers. Occurring as random events or dedicated physical signals, triggers effect transitions from one subsystem to another which might result in substantial changes of detectable behavior. From a modeling point of view, those subsystems typically differ in their reaction rules or principle of operation. We propose a formulation of trigger-based switching between models from a class of P systems with progression in time employing discretized mass-action kinetics. Two examples inspired by biological phenomena illustrate the consecutive interplay of P systems towards structural plasticity in reaction rules: evolutionary construction of reaction networks and artificial chemistries with self-reproducible subunits.},

The current paper presents an enhanced SimSoup model that is closer to real chemistry and more open ended. Molecules and the types of Interactions between them are constructed by the model itself using simple rules based on valence theory. Results of a preliminary run of the model are presented. Most of the Molecules produced are of a few simple types with low molecular weight. There is a ‘long tail’ of many low frequency Molecules, many of which are more complex with high molecular weight.},

Using artificial chemistry as a starting point to simulate life is a promising way to limit the possibilities because chemical reactions are always the same under the same physical conditions. We have built an 3D artificial chemistry system simulating molecules and the reactions among them. Our goal is to simulate a cell or a group of cells in the future using mainly molecules and chemical reactions. In this paper, we show that the system can simulate the fundamental aspects of reproduction, metabolism and adaptation in cells. This is accomplished by simulating reproducing molecules, reactions which provide energy to the reproducing molecules and the adaptation ability of reproducing molecules.},
