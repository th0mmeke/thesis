Abstract = {{A simple artificial chemistry for the Squirm3 artificial environment,
   consisting of replicators that produce quasi-universal enzymes, is
   presented. The aim of this system is twofold: first, to demonstrate the
   survival of extracellular replicators despite the presence of
   faster-replicating parasites; second, to observe the evolution of
   adaptively useful enzymes. Accomplishing these goals will underpin
   future attempts to attain open-ended and/or creative evolution in the
   Squirm3 environment. The first aim is achieved by attaching enzymes to
   their replicators. Our software implementation demonstrates replicators
   with 10 bases prospering in the presence of parasites with zero bases.
   To accomplish the second aim, a process for creating selection pressure
   toward longer molecules is introduced. The evolution and subsequent
   dominance of a replicator that produces an adaptively useful enzyme is
   demonstrated experimentally. Finally, we comment on the crucial role
   played by neutral evolution and discuss the biological significance of
   our results.}},

Abstract = {{The paper presents a model of coevolution of short peptides (P) and
   short oligonucleotides (N) at an early stage of chemical evolution
   leading to the origin of life. The model describes polymerization of
   both P and N types of molecules on mineral surfaces in aqueous solution
   at moderate temperatures. It is assumed that amino acid and nucleotide
   monomers were available in a prebiotic milieu, that periodic variation
   in environmental conditions between dry/warm and wet/cool took place and
   that energy sources were available for the polymerization. An artificial
   chemistry approach in combination with agent-based modeling was used to
   explore chemical evolution from an initially random mixture of monomers.
   It was assumed that the oligonucleotides could serve as templates for
   self-replication and for translation of peptide compositional sequences,
   and that certain peptides could serve as weak catalysts. Important
   features of the model are the short lengths of the peptide and
   oligonucleotide molecules that prevent an error catastrophe caused by
   copying errors and a finite diffusion rate of the molecules on a mineral
   surface that prevents excessive development of parasitism. The result of
   the simulation was the emergence of self-replicating molecular systems
   consisting of peptide catalysts and oligonucleotide templates. In
   addition, a smaller but significant number of molecules with alternative
   compositions also survived due to imprecise reproduction and translation
   of templates providing variability for further evolution. In a more
   general context, the model describes not only peptide-oligonucleotide
   molecular systems, but any molecular system containing two types of
   polymer molecules: one of which serves as templates and the other as
   catalysts.The presented coevolutionary system suggests a possible
   direction towards finding the origin of molecular functionality in a
   prebiotic environment.}},

Abstract = {{We examine the role of self-maintenance (collective autocatalysis) in
   the evolution of computational biochemical networks. In primitive
   proto-cells (lacking separate genetic machinery) self-maintenance is a
   necessary condition for the direct reproduction and inheritance of what
   we here term Cellular Information Processing Networks (CIPNs). Indeed,
   partially reproduced or defective CIPNs may generally lead to
   malfunctioning or premature death of affected cells. We explore the
   interaction of this self-maintenance property with the evolution and
   adaptation of CIPNs capable of distinct information processing
   abilities. We present an evolutionary simulation platform capable of
   evolving artificial CIPNs from a bottom-up perspective. This system is
   an agent-based multi-level selectional Artificial Chemistry (AC) which
   employs a term rewriting system called the Molecular Classifier System
   (MCS.bl). The latter is derived from the Holland broadcast language
   formalism. Using this system, we successfully evolve an artificial CIPN
   to improve performance on a simple pre-specified information processing
   task whilst subject to the constraint of continuous self-maintenance. We
   also describe the evolution of self-maintaining, cross-talking and
   multi-tasking, CIPNs exhibiting a higher level of topological and
   functional complexity. This proof of concept aims at contributing to the
   understanding of the open-ended evolutionary growth of complexity in

Abstract = {{Under the AChem paradigm and the programmed self-decomposition (PSD)
   model, we propose a hierarchical model for the biomolecular covalent
   bond (HBCB model). This model assumes that terrestrial organisms arrange
   their biomolecules in a hierarchical structure according to the energy
   strength of their covalent bonds. It also assumes that they have
   evolutionarily selected the PSD mechanism of turning biological polymers
   (BPs) into biological monomers (BMs) as an efficient biomolecular
   recycling strategy. We have examined the validity and effectiveness of
   the HBCB model by coordinating two complementary approaches: biological
   experiments using existent terrestrial life, and simulation experiments
   using an AChem system. Biological experiments have shown that
   terrestrial life possesses a PSD mechanism as an endergonic, genetically
   regulated process and that hydrolysis, which decomposes a BP into BMs,
   is one of the main processes of such a mechanism. In simulation
   experiments, we compared different virtual self-decomposition processes.
   The virtual species in which the self-decomposition process mainly
   involved covalent bond cleavage from a BP to BMs showed evolutionary
   superiority over other species in which the self-decomposition process
   involved cleavage from BP to classes lower than BM. These converging
   findings strongly support the existence of PSD and the validity and

Abstract = {{We propose conditions in which an autonomous agent could arise, and
   increase in complexity. It is assumed that on the primitive Earth there
   arose a recycling flow-reactor containing spontaneously formed oil
   droplets or lipid aggregates. These droplets grew at a basal rate by
   simple incorporation of lipid phase material, and divided by external
   agitation. This type of system was able to implement a natural selection
   algorithm once heredity was added. Macroevolution became possible by
   selection for rarely occurring chemical reactions that produced holistic
   autocatalytic molecular replicators (contained within the aggregate)
   capable of doubling at least as fast as the lipid aggregate, and which
   were also capable of benefiting the growth of its lipid aggregate
   container. No nucleotides or monomers capable of modular heredity were
   required at the outset. To explicitly state this hypothesis, a computer
   model was developed that employed an artificial chemistry, exhibiting
   conservation of mass and energy, incorporated within each individual of
   a population of lipid aggregates. This model evolved increasingly
   complex self-sustaining processes of constitution, a result that is also

   We propose and demonstrate a solution to this problem based on

Abstract = {{We propose that chemical evolution can take place by natural selection
   if a geophysical process is capable of heterotrophic formation of
   liposomes that grow at some base rate, divide by external agitation, and
   are subject to stochastic chemical avalanches, in the absence of
   nucleotides or any monomers capable of modular heredity. We model this
   process using a simple hill-climbing algorithm, and an artificial
   chemistry that is unique in exhibiting conservation of mass and energy
   in an open thermodynamic system. Selection at the liposome level results
   in the stabilization of rarely occurring molecular autocatalysts that
   either catalyse or are consumed in reactions that confer liposome level
   fitness; typically they contribute in parallel to an increasingly
   conserved intermediary metabolism. Loss of competing autocatalysts can
   sometimes be adaptive. Steady-state energy flux by the individual
   increases due to the energetic demands of growth, but also of memory,
   i.e. maintaining variations in the chemical network. Self-organizing
   principles such as those proposed by Kauffman, Fontana, and Morowitz
   have been hypothesized as an ordering principle in chemical evolution,
   rather than chemical evolution by natural selection. We reject those

Abstract = {{It has been pointed out that the acquisition of self-maintaining

   earliest stage of life. However, there remains little evidence to show
   what the components of the protocells were and how they were acquired. A
   theoretical study to investigate the possible process of the emergence
   of protocells is therefore required. In this paper, we present a
   computational model that demonstrates the emergence and evolution of
   self-maintaining and self-reproducing structures to analyze conditions
   under which precellular autocatalytic molecules could evolve into
   self-reproducing protocells. We focused on the supply rates of molecular
   resources as environmental parameters and explored the pathways of
   evolution from molecular replication to cellular reproduction under
   various conditions. The results showed that the spontaneous organization
   of protocells from a random initial state takes place in a parameter
   region where the metabolism becomes difficult because of an insufficient
   supply of resources, but once cell structures are organized, they can
   survive in a wider range of environments. We investigated the evolution
   in temporally or spatially changing environments and found that the
   protocells can take over the precellular metabolic system after the

Abstract = {{Assembling non-biological materials (geomaterials) into a proto-organism
   constitutes a bridge between nonliving and living matter. In this
   article we 2 present a simple step-by-step route to assemble a
   proto-organism. Many pictures have been proposed to describe this
   transition within the origins-of-life and artificial life communities,
   and more recently alternative pictures have been emerging from advances
   in nanoscience and biotechnology. The proposed proto-organism lends
   itself to both traditions and defines a new picture based on a simple
   idea: Given a set of required functionalities, minimize the
   physicochemical structures that support these functionalities, and make
   sure that all Structures self-assemble and Mutually enhance each other's
   existence. The result is the first concrete, rational design of a simple
   physicochemical system that integrates the key functionalities in a
   thermodynamically favorable manner as a lipid aggregate integrates
   proto-genes and a proto-metabolisin. Under external pumping of free
   energy, the metabolic processes produce the required building blocks,
   and only specific gene sequences enhance the metabolic kinetics
   sufficiently for the whole system to survive. We propose an experimental
   implementation of the proto-organism with a discussion of our
   experimental results, together with relevant results produced by other
   experimental groups, and we specify what is still missing
   experimentally. Identifying the missing steps is just as important as
   providing the road map for the transition. We derive the kinetic and
   thermodynamic conditions of each of the proto-organism subsystems
   together with relevant theoretical and computational results about these
   subsystems. We present and discuss detailed 3D simulations of the lipid
   aggregation processes. From the reaction kinetics we derive analytical
   aggregate size distributions, and derive key properties of the metabolic
   efficiency and stability. Thermodynamics and kinetics of the ligation
   directed self-replication of the proto-genes is discussed, and we
   summarize the full life cycle of the proto-organism by comparing size,
   replication time, and energy with the biomass efficiency of contemporary
   unicells. Finally, we also compare our proto-organism picture with
   existing origins-of-life and protocell pictures.
   By assembling one possible bridge between nonliving and living matter we
   hope to provide a piece in the ancient puzzle about who we are and where

Abstract = {{A model of artificial chemistry in which both genotypic and phenotypic
   strings mingle together and react with each other is presented. A cell
   that includes a string set for the replication and translation of
   genetic information is designed on this system, and the cells are
   reproduced by cell division cycles. From experiments that emulate cell
   selection, it is shown that a complete set of genes constituting the
   designed system can be stably transmitted to the offspring cells if they
   are put into a long single chromosome or the gene replication is
   strictly regulated and the replicated genes are transferred to the two
   daughter cells by a spindle.}},

   multi-agent bacteria ecosystem. Each bacterium is encoded on a DNA-like
   genome which is interpreted to specify the gene binding sites and
   protein production rules. Protein and gene compounds interact in an
   artificial chemistry, producing regulatory networks and observable
   behaviours such as moving, splitting and eating. Through genome
   inheritance and mutation, a virtual bacteria culture evolves.}},

Abstract = {{A simplified model of Darwinian evolution at the molecular level is
   studied by applying the methods of artificial chemistry. A chemical
   reactor (chemostat) contains molecules that are represented by binary
   strings, the strings being capable of replication with a probability
   proportional to their fitness. Moreover, the process of replication is
   not fully precise, sporadic mutations may produce new offspring strings,
   which are slightly different from their parent templates. The dynamics
   of such an autoreplicating system is described by Eigen's differential
   equations. These equations have a unique asymptotically stable state,
   which corresponds to those strings that have the highest rate constants
   (fitness). Fitness of binary string is calculated as a graph-theory
   similarity between a folding (phenotype) of respective string and the
   so-called required folding. The presented method offers a detailed view
   of mechanisms of the molecular Darwinian evolution, in particular of the
   meaning and importance of neutral mutations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper gives details of Squirm3, a new artificial environment based
   on a simple physics and chemistry that supports self-replicating
   molecules somewhat similar to DNA. The self-replicators emerge
   spontaneously from a random soup given the right conditions.
   Interactions between the replicators can result in mutated versions that
   can outperform their parents. We show how artificial chemistries such as
   this one can be implemented as a cellular automaton. We concur with
   Dittrich, Ziegler, and Banzhaf that artificial chemistries are a good
   medium in which to study early evolution.}},

Abstract = {{An artificial chemistry is a branch of contemporary computer science
   that uses a chemical metaphor as a new highly parallel approach to
   computations. It can be defined by (1) a set of objects (a chemostat
   composed of molecules) and (2) a set of transformation rules (chemical
   reactions), which specify how the objects are transformed into other
   objects. The purpose of the present short communication is to use the
   well-known Eigen's chemical system of replicators as a new (chemical)
   metaphor. It is then applied in design of the so-called replicator
   algorithm. This algorithm has some common features with genetic
   algorithms, but as an advantage of the presented replicator algorithm we
   consider an existence of relatively simple proof that the algorithm
   offers globally optimal solutions.}},

   allows the molecules to act only locally along the edges. We observe the

   self-maintaining proto-cells and the elastic nodes as their
   proto-membrane. The possibility for these cells to be autopoietic is
