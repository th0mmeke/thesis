    Arguments for or against a trend in the evolution of complexity are
  weakened by the lack of an unambiguous definition of complexity. Such
  definitions abound for both dynamical systems and biological organisms, but
  have drawbacks of either a conceptual or a practical nature. Physical
  complexity, a measure based on automata theory and information theory, is a
  simple and intuitive measure of the amount of information that an organism
  stores, in its genome, about the environment in which it evolves. It is
  argued that physical complexity must increase in molecular evolution of
  asexual organisms in a single niche if the environment does not change, due
  to natural selection. It is possible that complexity decreases in co-evolving
  systems as well as at high mutation rates, in sexual populations, and in
  time-dependent landscapes. However, it is reasoned that these factors usually
  help, rather than hinder, the evolution of complexity, and that a theory of
  physical complexity for co-evolving species will reveal an overall trend
  towards higher complexity in biological evolution.%

    Self-replication is a fundamental property of many interesting physical,
  formal and biological systems, such as crystals, waves, automata, and
  especially forms of natural and artificial life. Despite its importance to
  many phenomena, self-replication has not been consistently defined or
  quantified in a rigorous, universal way. In this paper we propose a
  universal, continuously valued property of the interaction between a system
  and its environment. This property represents the effect of the presence of
  such a system upon the future presence of similar systems. We demonstrate
  both analytical and computational analysis of self-replicability factors for
  three distinct systems involving both discrete and continuous behaviors.%

    For millennia people have wondered what makes the living different from the
  non-living. Beginning in the mid-1980s, artificial life has studied living
  systems using a synthetic approach: build life in order to understand it
  better, be it by means of software, hardware, or wetware. This review
  provides a summary of the advances that led to the development of artificial
  life, its current research topics, and open problems and opportunities. We
  classify artificial life research into 14 themes: origins of life, autonomy,
  self-organization, adaptation (including evolution, development, and
  learning), ecology, artificial societies, behavior, computational biology,
  artificial chemistries, information, living technology, art, and philosophy.
  Being interdisciplinary, artificial life seems to be losing its boundaries
  and merging with other fields.%

    Artificial Life is a research field which has developed around the use of
  synthetic artificial systems, mostly robotic and virtual, to investigate the
  supposed characteristic features of life. The thesis presents a case study of
  Artificial Life, with the overall objective of understanding some of the
  cultural, disciplinary and epistemological developments that may be
  distinctive of research communities who ground their work on a collaborative
  involvement with non-human simulation models. The study examines the cultural
  identity of the Artificial Life research community and its knowledgemaking
  practices, as well as its sustainability strategies into existing
  institutional contexts. The study aims at being neither an over-localized
  laboratory micro-study nor an over general macro-study, but tries to situate
  itself in the mid-range by combining both approaches. It has been conducted
  through a combination of ethnographical fieldwork and of bibliographical
  analysis, and places a special focus on the Artificial Life research group at
  University of Sussex, which has been selected for its centrality in the
  global Artificial Life landscape.%

    Living organisms are robust to a great variety of genetic changes. Gene
  regulation networks and metabolic pathways self-organize and reaccommodate to
  make the organism perform with stability and reliability under many point
  mutations, gene duplications and gene deletions. At the same time, living
  organisms are evolvable, which means that these kind of genetic perturbations
  can eventually make the organism acquire new functions and adapt to new
  environments. It is still an open problem to determine how robustness and
  evolvability blend together at the genetic level to produce stable organisms
  that yet can change and evolve. Here we address this problem by studying the
  robustness and evolvability of the attractor landscape of genetic regulatory
  network models under the process of gene duplication followed by divergence.
  We show that an intrinsic property of this kind of networks is that, after
  the divergence of the parent and duplicate genes, with a high probability the
  previous phenotypes, encoded in the attractor landscape of the network, are
  preserved and new ones might appear. The above is true in a variety of
  network topologies and even for the case of extreme divergence in which the
  duplicate gene bears almost no relation with its parent. Our results indicate
  that networks operating close to the so-called "critical regime" exhibit the
  maximum robustness and evolvability simultaneously. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

    Hypothesis that attractors of a genetic network correspond to cellular
  types or cellular fates (such as apoptosis, quiescence, proliferation,
  differentiation) previously partially confirmed (several citations from 2000
  on). Robustness therefore can be addressed by studying the conservation and
  transformation of the attractor landscape of the GRN under pertubations.
  Study only considers pertubations from gene duplication and divergence,
  qualified by evidence that this is a major mechanism in genome growth and
  evolution. Methodology: Random Boolean Networks, with two different
  topologies: 1) homogenous random - each gene has exactly K randomly chosen
  inputs. Included as a reference model. 2) scale-free - number of outputs of
  each gene follows a power-law distribution, outputs chosen randomly. (Results
  in number of inputs for each gene following a Poisson distribution.) Believed
  to better fit the networks observed experimentally for several organisms.
  WHAT IS BEING CLAIMED? GRNs of living organisms operate close to critical
  phase, since one obtains maximum robustness and evolvability simultaneously
  in same system Networks operating in the ordered and critical regimes are
  intrinsically robust against duplication and full divergence of one gene.
  With a high probability, attractors are not conserved for networks operating
  in the chaotic regime. New attractors emerge under duplication and divergence
  for networks in ordered and critical regimes. Critical networks have highest
  probability to acquire new attractors while preserving all the old ones.
  Duplication and divergence for networks in critical regimes can lead also to
  transformations of the conserved basins of attraction - that is, a change to
  the differentiation and gene expression pathways of the whole network.
  Robustness is not a function of redundancy, but an emergent property of the
  network. WHAT ASSUMPTIONS ARE MADE? Only pertubations studied are gene
  duplications and divergence - "one of the main mechanisms of genome growth
  and evolution is gene duplication followed by genetic divergence" GRN
  modelled by a RBN (Kauffman 1969 etc) using 'quenched' model - where inputs
  and boolean rule for each gene chosen only once and remain fixed through
  temporal evolution of network. No need to examine networks of more than
  approx. 200 genes as dynamical properties come from regulatory genes, not
  total number of genes (Medusa network model) IS THE RESEARCH DESCRIBED STILL
  CURRENT? SIGNIFICANCE - PLACE IN RESEARCH? PROBLEM THAT IS ADDRESSED?
  Attractor landscapes of GRNs - support for hypothesis that dynamical
  attractors correspond to different cell types or cell fates: Albert and
  Othmer 2003 (topology), Mendoza and Alvarez-Buylla 2000, Espinosa-Soto et al
  2004, Huang and Ingber 2000 (switching between attractors), Huang et al 2005

  topology appears to better fit experimental data from transcriptional
  regulation: Albert 2005, Guelzim et al 2002 (Yeast), Babu et al 2004

  Alberts et al 2002 (14,000 genes in fly, 19,000 in worm, 10,000
  nucleotides/gene non-coding DNA for fly, 5,000 for worm, but fly seems more

    We discuss a system of autocatalytic sequences of binary numbers. Sequences
  come in two forms, a 1dimensional form (operands) and a 2-dimensional form
  (operators) that are able to react with each other. The resulting reaction
  network shows signs of emerging metabolisms. We discuss the general framework
  and examine specific interactions for a system with strings of length 4 bits.
  A selfmaintaining network of string types and parasitic interactions are
  shown to exist%

    The open-endedness of a system is often defined as a continual production
  of novelty. Here we pin down this concept more fully by defining several
  types of novelty that a system may exhibit, classified as variation,
  innovation, and emergence. We then provide a meta-model for including levels
  of structure in a system’s model. From there, we define an architecture
  suitable for building simulations of open-ended novelty-generating systems
  and discuss how previously proposed systems fit into this framework. We
  discuss the design principles applicable to those systems and close with some
  challenges for the community.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    When dealing with multiobjective optimization (MO) of the tire-suspension
  system of a racing car, a large number-of design variables and a large number
  of objectives have to be taken into account. Two different models have been
  used, both validated on data coming from an instrumented car, a differential
  equation-based physical model, and a neural network purely numerical model.
  Up to 23 objective functions have been defined, at least 14 of which are in
  strict conflict of each other. The equivalent scalar function based and the
  objective-as-constraint formulations are intentionally avoided due to their
  well-known limitations. A fuzzy definition of optima, being a generalization
  of Pareto optimality, is applied to the problem. The result of such an
  approach is that subsets of Pareto optimal solutions (on such a problem, a
  big portion of the entire search space) can be properly selected as a
  consequence of input from the designer. The obtained optimal solutions are
  compared with the reference vehicle and with the optima previously obtained
  with design of experiment techniques and different MO optimization
  strategies. The proposed strategy improves both the reference (actual) car
  and previously obtained optima (scalar preference function) in the majority
  of objectives with technically significant improvements. Moreover, the
  strategy offers an univoque criterion for the choice among tradeoff solutions
  in the 14-dimensional objective space. The problem is used as a test 4 a
  proposed optimal design strategy for industrial problems, integrating
  differential equation and neural networks modeling, design of experiments,
  MO, and fuzzy optimal-based decision making. Such a linked approach gives
  also a unified view of where to concentrate the computational effort.%

    Large scale chemical reaction networks are a ubiquitous phenomenon, from
  the metabolism of living cells to processes in planetary atmospheres and
  chemical technology. At least some of these networks exhibit distinctive
  global features such as the "small world" behavior. The systematic study of
  such properties, however, suffers from substantial sampling biases in the few
  networks that are known in detail. A computational model for generating them
  is therefore required. Here we present a Toy Model that provides a consistent
  framework in which generic properties of extensive chemical reaction networks
  can be explored in detail and that at the same time preserves the
  "look-and-feel" of chemistry: Molecules are represented as labeled graphs,
  i.e., by their structural formulas; their basic properties are derived by a
  caricature version of the Extended Huckel MO theory that operates directly on
  the graphs; chemical reaction mechanisms are implemented as graph rewriting
  rules acting on the structural formulas; reactivities and selectivities are
  modeled by a variant of the Frontier Molecular Orbital Theory based on the
  Extended Huckel scheme. The approach is illustrated for two types of reaction
  networks: Diels-Alder reactions and the formose reaction implicated in
  prebiotic sugar synthesis.%

    Abstract Large chemical reaction networks often exhibit distinctive
  features that can be interpreted as higher-level structures. Prime examples
  are metabolic pathways in a biochemical context. We review mathematical
  approaches that exploit the stoichiometric structure, which can be seen as a
  particular directed hypergraph, to derive an algebraic picture of chemical
  organizations. We then give an alternative interpretation in terms of
  set-valued set functions that encapsulate the production rules of the
  individual reactions. From the mathematical point of view, these functions
  define generalized topological spaces on the set of chemical species. We show
  that organization-theoretic concepts also appear in a natural way in the
  topological language. This abstract representation in turn suggests the
  exploration of the chemical meaning of well-established topological concepts.
  As an example, we consider connectedness in some detail.%

    This paper explores the use of growth processes, or embryogenies, to map
  genotypes to phenotypes within evolutionary systems. Following a summary of
  the significant features of embryogenies, the three main types of
  embryogenies in Evolutionary Computation are then identified and explained:
  external, explicit and implicit. An experimental comparison between these
  three different embryogenies and an evolutionary algorithm with no embryogeny
  is performed. The problem set to the four evolutionary systems is to evolve
  tessellating tiles. In order to assess the scalability of the embryogenies,
  the problem is increased in difficulty by enlarging the size of tiles to be
  evolved. The results are surprising, with the implicit embryogeny
  outperforming all other techniques by showing no significant increase in the
  size of the genotypes or decrease in accuracy of evolution as the scale of
  the problem is increased.%

    This rather philosophical paper discusses the necessary three ingredients
  which together allow a collective phenomenon to be described as "emergent".
  First the phenomenon, as usual, requires a group of agents entering in a
  non-linear relationship and entailing the existence of two semantic
  descriptions depending on the scale of observation. Second this phenomenon
  has to be observed by a mechanical observer instead of a human one, which has
  the natural capacity for temporal and/or spatial integration. Finally, for
  this natural observer to detect and select the collective phenomenon, it
  needs to do so in rewards of the adaptive value this phenomenon is
  responsible for. The presence of natural selection drives us to defend, with
  many authors, the idea that emergent phenomena can only belong to biology.
  After a brief philosophical plea, we present a simple and illustrative
  computer thought experiment in which a society of agents evolves a stigmergic
  collective behavior as an outcome of its greater adaptive value. The three
  ingredients are illustrated and discussed within this experimental context.%

    Two simplified models of Darwinian evolution at the molecular level are
  studied by applying the methods of artificial chemistry. First, a metaphor of
  a chemical reactor (chemostat) is considered. It contains molecules that are
  represented by binary strings, the strings being capable of replication with
  a probability proportional to their fitness. Moreover, the process of
  replication is not fully precise, sporadic mutations may produce new
  offspring strings, which are slightly different from their parent templates.
  In the framework of this approach we postulate a folding of binary strings
  into a secondary 2D structure. The proposed chemostat method offers a
  detailed view of mechanisms of the molecular Darwinian evolution, in
  particular of the meaning and importance of neutral mutations. Second, a
  simplified formal system Typogenetics, introduced by Hofstadter, is
  discussed. Concepts of replicators and hypercycles, defined within
  Typogenetics, belong to the basic entities in current perception of
  artificial life. A metaphor of chemical reactions is applied to study an
  emergence of replicators and hypercycles.%

    In this report we introduce an artificial evolutionary system, Artificial
  Ontogeny (AO), that uses a developmental encoding scheme to translate a given
  genotype into a complete agent, which then acts in a physically-realistic
  virtual environment. Evolution is accomplished using a genetic algorithm, in
  which the genotypes are treated as genetic regulatory networks. The dynamics
  of the regulatory network direct the growth of the agent, and lead to the
  construction of both the morphology and neural control of the agent. We
  demonstrate that such a model can be used to evolve agents to perforin
  non-trivial tasks, such as directed locomotion and block pushing in a noisy
  environment. It is shown that mutations expressed earlier in development tend
  to have a more variable morphological and behavioural effect than mutations
  expressed later in development, which tend to have a less pronounced effect.
  These results support the hypothesis that ontogeny provides artificial
  evolution with beneficial mutations that have varying degrees of phenotypic
  effect, depending on their onset of expression during development. In
  addition, we evolve agents using a fitness function which indirectly selects
  for increased size. In these agents we find evidence of functional
  specialization and repeated, differentiated structure. In the final section
  we argue that such a system would be a useful tool for the evolutionary
  design of morpo-functional machines.%

    This thesis examines the theoretical and philosophical underpinnings of the
  concept of natural selection which is pervasively invoked in biology and
  other 'evolutionary' domains. Although what constitutes the process of
  natural selection appears to be very intuitive (natural selection results
  from entities exhibiting differences in fitness in a population), this
  conceals a number of theoretical ambiguities and difficulties. Some of these
  have been pointed out numerous times; others have hardly been noticed. One
  aim of this work is to unpack these difficulties and ambiguities; another is
  to provide new solutions and clarifications to them using a range of
  philosophical and conceptual tools. The result is a concept of natural
  selection stripped down from its biological specificities. I start by
  revisiting the entangled debates over whether natural selection is a cause of
  evolutionary change as opposed to a mere statistical effect of other causes,
  at what level this putative cause operates and whether it can be
  distinguished from drift. Borrowing tools from the causal modelling
  literature, I argue that natural selection is best conceived as a causal
  process resulting from individual level differences in a population. I then
  move to the question of whether the process of natural selection requires
  perfect transmission of types. I show that this question is ambiguous and can
  find different answers. From there, I distinguish the process of natural
  selection from some of its possible products, namely, evolution by natural
  selection and complex adaptation. I argue that reproduction and inheritance
  are conceptually distinct from natural selection, and using individual-based
  models, I demonstrate that they can be conceived as evolutionary products of
  it. This ultimately leads me to generalise the concepts of heritability and
  fitness used in the formal equations of evolutionary change. Finally, I argue
  that concepts of fitness and natural selection crucially depend on the grains
  of description at and temporal scales over which evolutionary explanations
  are given. These considerations reveal that the metaphysical status of the
  process of natural selection is problematic and why neglecting them can lead
  to flawed arguments in the levels of selection debate.%

  can be used as a powerful constraint to help organize and explain the deep
  evolution of life on Earth. Using a novel method that fully integrates
  aspects of metabolic and phylogenetic analysis, we are able to reconstruct
  the complete early evolutionary history of biological carbon-fixation,
  relating all ways in which life today performs this function to a single
  ancestral form. The diversification in carbon-fixation appears to underpin
  most of the deepest branches in the tree of life, and this early metabolic
  diversification - reaching back to the first cells - appears to have been
  driven not by the contingencies of history, but by direct links to the
  physical-chemical environment. The ancestral carbon-fixation pathway that we
  identify is different from any modern form, but better suited to the
  capabilities of the earliest primitive cells.</p>%

    How life emerged on this planet is one of the most important and
  fundamental questions of science. Although nearly all details concerning our
  origins have been lost in the depths of time, there is compelling evidence to
  suggest that the earliest life might have exploited the catalytic and
  self-recognition properties of RNA to survive. If an RNA based replicating
  system could be constructed in the laboratory, it would be much easier to
  understand the challenges associated with the very earliest steps in
  evolution and provide important insight into the establishment of the complex
  metabolic systems that now dominate this planet. Recent progress into the
  selection and characterization of ribozymes that promote nucleotide synthesis
  and RNA polymerization are discussed and outstanding problems in the field of
  RNA-mediated RNA replication are summarized.%

    Development of the animal body plan is controlled by large gene regulatory
  networks (GRNs), and hence evolution of body plans must depend upon change in
  the architecture of developmental GRNs. However, these networks are composed
  of diverse components that evolve at different rates and in different ways.
  Because of the hierarchical organization of developmental GRNs, some kinds of
  change affect terminal properties of the body plan such as occur in
  speciation, whereas others affect major aspects of body plan morphology. A
  notable feature of the paleontological record of animal evolution is the
  establishment by the Early Cambrian of virtually all phylum-level body plans.
  We identify a class of GRN component, the "kernels" of the network, which,
  because of their developmental rote and their particular internal structure,
  are most impervious to change. Conservation of phyletic body plans may have
  been due to the retention since pre-Cambrian time of GRN kernels, which
  underlie development of major body parts.%

    Different proteins have different expression levels. It is unclear to what
  extent these expression levels are optimized to their environment.
  Evolutionary theories suggest that protein expression levels maximize
  fitness1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, but the fitness as a function of
  protein level has seldom been directly measured. To address this, we studied
  the lac system of Escherichia coli, which allows the cell to use the sugar
  lactose for growth12. We experimentally measured the growth burden13, 14 due
  to production and maintenance of the Lac proteins (cost), as well as the
  growth advantage (benefit) conferred by the Lac proteins when lactose is
  present. The fitness function, given by the difference between the benefit
  and the cost, predicts that for each lactose environment there exists an
  optimal Lac expression level that maximizes growth rate. We then performed
  serial dilution evolution experiments at different lactose concentrations. In
  a few hundred generations, cells evolved to reach the predicted optimal
  expression levels. Thus, protein expression from the lac operon seems to be a
  solution of a cost--benefit optimization problem, and can be rapidly tuned by
  evolution to function optimally in new environments.%

    This paper introduces a continuous model for Multi-cellular Developmental
  Design. The cells are fixed on a 2D grid and exchange ``chemicals{''} with
  their neighbors during the growth process. The quantity of chemicals that a
  cell produces, as well as the differentiation value of the cell in the
  phenotype, are controlled by a Neural Network (the genotype) that takes as
  inputs the chemicals produced by the neighboring cells at the previous time
  step. In the proposed model, the number of iterations of the growth process
  is not pre-determined, but emerges during evolution: only organisms for which
  the growth process stabilize's give a phenotype (the stable state), others
  are declared nonviable. The optimization of the controller is done using the
  NEAT algorithm, that optimizes both the topology and the weights of the.
  Neural Networks. Though each cell only receives local information front its
  neighbors, the experimental results of the proposed approach on the `flags'
  problems (the phenotype must match a. given 2D pattern) are almost as good as
  those of a direct regression approach using the same model with global
  information. Moreover, the resulting multi-cellular organisms exhibit almost
  perfect self-healing characteristics.%

    We review and critique a range of perspectives on the scientific role of
  individual-based evolutionary simulation models as they are used within
  artificial life. We find that such models have the potential to enrich
  existing modelling enterprises through their strength in modelling systems of
  interacting entities. Furthermore, simulation techniques promise to provide
  theoreticians in various fields with entirely new conceptual, as well as
  methodological, approaches. However, the precise manner in which simulations
  can be used as models is not clear. We present two apparently opposed
  perspectives on this issue: simulation models as ``emergent computational
  thought experiments{''} and simulation models as realistic simulacra. Through
  analysing the role that armchair thought experiments play in science, we
  develop a role for simulation models as opaque thought experiments, that is,
  thought experiments in which the consequences follow from the premises, but
  in a non-obvious manner which must be revealed through systematic enquiry.
  Like their better-known transparent cousins, opaque thought experiments, when
  understood, result in new insights and conceptual reorganisations. These may
  stress the current theoretical position of the thought experimenter and
  engender empirical predictions which must be tested in reality. As such,
  simulation models, like all thought experiments, are tools with which to
  explore the consequences of a theoretical position.%

    This paper adopts an interdisciplinary view of the significant elements of
  ecosystems and the methods by which these might be simulated to explore
  theoretical issues of relevance to Artificial Life and Ecology. Artificial
  Life has largely been concerned with evolutionary ecosystems of agents in
  trivial environments. Ecology commonly produces models of specific habitats
  and organism populations unsuited to general exploration of theoretical
  issues. We propose that limitations of the simulations in these disciplines
  can be overcome by simulating ecosystems from the level of artificial
  chemistry. We demonstrate the approach's feasibility by describing several
  virtual organisms represented at this level. The organisms automatically
  adopt trophic levels, generate energy from chemical bonds and transform
  material elements in the process. Virtual organisms may interact with one
  another and their abiotic environment using the same chemistry. Biosynthesis
  and decay may also be simulated through this mechanism.%

    In this chapter we emphasize the most crucial developments in the design of
  artificial creatures starting with the seminal work of Karl Sims presented at
  the SIGGRAPH'94 conference and ending with the latest research in virtual
  beings based on cell development. Nowadays much research relies on the same
  principles in order to generate more and more complex artificial beings but
  also to advance evolutionary robotics with prototypes capable of
  self-modeling, self-reproduction and self-assembly. Inspired by biology, this
  research moves closer to nature paradigms, considering the creature as the
  result of a developmental process of a single element: a cell. This logic,
  presented here, as the bio-logic of artificial creature, needs not only new
  simulators such as chemical or hydrodynamic environments but also new
  mechanisms such as an artificial regulatory network to control the
  development process. Although these new beings are endowed with a very simple
  metabolism, they are still capable of transforming their local environment in
  order to grow and to piece together ``logical organs{''}.%

    Self-assembly and self-replication are the main common thematic features of
  living organism. The life of most living organisms bases on biomolecular
  systems such as DNA and RNA. Self-replication and assembly are emergent
  properties of such systems. These biomolecular systems have common thematic
  features that enable them from self-replicating and self-assembling
  themselves. In this paper, I try to generalize these common thematic features
  to generate a generalized model of the complement-based self-replicated,
  self-assembled systems. In this model, I explained the main requirements for
  achieving these systems in terms of basic system components and how these
  components interact with each other through self-assembling rule set and
  complement-based replication rule set generating systems with potential to be
  self-replicated machines. After generating this model, I have applied this
  model to DNA and simulated its basics.%

    Artificial Chemistry seeks to explore how life-like systems can emerge from
  a pre-biotic environment. This thesis begins with the background of this
  research area and a re-implementation of an existing Artificial Chemistry as
  a case study. From this basis, ingredients and properties of Artificial
  Chemistries are identified. This leads to a novel form of molecular
  representation -- sub-symbolic. A group of novel Artificial Chemistries
  called RBN-World is developed using Random Boolean Networks as a sub-symbolic
  molecular representation. It is shown that RBN-World has several properties
  of interest, and variants of RBN-World and elemental subsets with those
  properties are identified from many alternatives. This thesis concludes by
  comparing RBN-World to the case study and properties discussed earlier, and
  identifies avenues for future work.%

    An Artificial Chemistry (AChem) is a set of components and interactions
  that result in a composable system. Ideally, the system is rich, and results
  in rich higher-order emergent properties. We present a methodology for
  discovering interesting AChems through a series of tests that probe
  elementary low level properties. In doing so, we assume that these elementary
  properties are a necessary, but not sufficient, basis for higher-order
  emergent properties, such as autocatalytic sets and hypercycles. The test
  strategy is applied to RBN-World, a sub-symbolic chemistry. This results in
  identifying a number of new and interesting RBN-World chemistries that appear
  richer than our original parameterisation.%

    A new method to generate chemical reaction network is proposed. The
  particularity of the method is that network generation and mechanism
  reduction are performed simultaneously using sampling techniques. Our method
  is tested for hydrocarbon thermal cracking. Results and theoretical arguments
  demonstrate that our method scales in polynomial time while other
  deterministic network generators scale in exponential time. This finding
  offers the possibility of investigating complex reacting systems such as
  those studied in petroleum refining and combustion.%

    To increase the evolvability of larger search spaces, several indirect
  encoding strategies have been proposed. Among these, multicellular
  developmental systems are believed to offer great potential for the evolution
  of general, scalable, and self-repairing organisms. We reinforce this view,
  presenting the results achieved by such a model and comparing it against
  direct encoding. Extra effort has been made to make this comparison both
  general and meaningful. Embryonal stages, a generic method showing increased
  evolvability and applicable to any developmental model, are introduced.
  Development with embryonal stages implements what we refer to as direct
  neutral complexification: direct genotype complexification by neutral
  duplication of expressed genes. The results show that, even for
  high-complexity evolutionary targets, the developmental model proves more
  scalable. The model also shows emergent self-repair, which is used to produce
  highly resilient organisms.%

    An artificial chemistry is embedded in a triangular planar graph, that
  allows the molecules to act only locally along the edges. We observe the
  formation of effectively separated components in the graph structure. Those
  components are kept separated by elastic reactions from molecules generated
  inside the component itself. We interpret those components as
  self-maintaining proto-cells and the elastic nodes as their proto-membrane.
  The possibility for these cells to be autopoietic is discussed.%

    We propose that chemical evolution can take place by natural selection if a
  geophysical process is capable of heterotrophic formation of liposomes that
  grow at some base rate, divide by external agitation, and are subject to
  stochastic chemical avalanches, in the absence of nucleotides or any monomers
  capable of modular heredity. We model this process using a simple
  hill-climbing algorithm, and an artificial chemistry that is unique in
  exhibiting conservation of mass and energy in an open thermodynamic system.
  Selection at the liposome level results in the stabilization of rarely
  occurring molecular autocatalysts that either catalyse or are consumed in
  reactions that confer liposome level fitness; typically they contribute in
  parallel to an increasingly conserved intermediary metabolism. Loss of
  competing autocatalysts can sometimes be adaptive. Steady-state energy flux
  by the individual increases due to the energetic demands of growth, but also
  of memory, i.e. maintaining variations in the chemical network.
  Self-organizing principles such as those proposed by Kauffman, Fontana, and
  Morowitz have been hypothesized as an ordering principle in chemical
  evolution, rather than chemical evolution by natural selection. We reject
  those notions as either logically flawed or at best insufficient in the
  absence of natural selection. Finally, a finite population model without
  elitism shows the practical evolutionary constraints for achieving chemical
  evolution by natural selection in the lab. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

    We propose conditions in which an autonomous agent could arise, and
  increase in complexity. It is assumed that on the primitive Earth there arose
  a recycling flow-reactor containing spontaneously formed oil droplets or
  lipid aggregates. These droplets grew at a basal rate by simple incorporation
  of lipid phase material, and divided by external agitation. This type of
  system was able to implement a natural selection algorithm once heredity was
  added. Macroevolution became possible by selection for rarely occurring
  chemical reactions that produced holistic autocatalytic molecular replicators
  (contained within the aggregate) capable of doubling at least as fast as the
  lipid aggregate, and which were also capable of benefiting the growth of its
  lipid aggregate container. No nucleotides or monomers capable of modular
  heredity were required at the outset. To explicitly state this hypothesis, a
  computer model was developed that employed an artificial chemistry,
  exhibiting conservation of mass and energy, incorporated within each
  individual of a population of lipid aggregates. This model evolved
  increasingly complex self-sustaining processes of constitution, a result that
  is also expected in real chemistry.%

    Micro-organisms play a central role in every ecosystem and in the global
  biomass cycle. They are strongly involved in many fields of human interest,
  from medicine to the food industry and waste control. Nevertheless, most
  micro-organisms remain almost unknown, and nearly 99% of them have not yet
  been successfully cultured in vitro. Therefore, new approaches and new tools
  must be developed in order to understand the collective behaviour of
  microbial communities in any natural or artificial setting. In particular,
  theoretical and practical methodologies to deal with such systems at a
  mesoscopic level of description (covering the range from 100 to 10(8) cells)
  are required. Individual-based modelling (IBM) has become a widely used tool
  for describing complex systems made up of autonomous entities, such as
  ecosystems and social networks. Individual-based models (IBMs) provide some
  advantages over the traditional whole-population models: (a) they are
  bottom-up approaches, so they describe the behaviour of a system as a whole
  by establishing procedural rules for the individuals and for their
  interactions, and thus allow more realistic assumptions for the model of the
  individuals than population models do; (b) they permit the introduction of
  randomness and individual variability, so they can reproduce the diversity
  found in real systems; and (c) they can account for individual adaptive
  behaviour to their environmental conditions, so the evolution of the whole
  system arises from the dynamics that govern individuals in their pursuit of
  optimal fitness. However, they also present some drawbacks: they lack the
  clarity of continuous models and may easily become rambling, which makes them
  difficult to analyse and communicate. All in all, IBMs supply a holistic
  description of microbial systems and their emerging properties. They are
  specifically appropriate to deal with microbial communities in non-steady
  states, and spatially explicit IBMs are particularly appropriate to study
  laboratory and natural microbiological systems with spatial heterogeneity. In
  this paper, we review IBM methodology applied to microbiology. We also
  present some results obtained from the application of Individual Discrete
  Simulations, an IBM of ours, to the study of bacterial communities, yeast
  cultures and Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes in vitro cultures of
  Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes.%

    BACKGROUND:The metabolic architectures of extant organisms share many key
  pathways such as the citric acid cycle, glycolysis, or the biosynthesis of
  most amino acids. Several competing hypotheses for the evolutionary
  mechanisms that shape metabolic networks have been discussed in the
  literature, each of which finds support from comparative analysis of extant
  genomes. Alternatively, the principles of metabolic evolution can be studied
  by direct computer simulation. This requires, however, an explicit
  implementation of all pertinent components: a universe of chemical reactions
  upon which the metabolism is built, an explicit representation of the enzymes
  that implement the metabolism, a genetic system that encodes these enzymes,
  and a fitness function that can be selected for.RESULTS:We describe here a
  simulation environment that implements all these components in a simplified
  way so that large-scale evolutionary studies are feasible. We employ an
  artificial chemistry that views chemical reactions as graph rewriting
  operations and utilizes a toy-version of quantum chemistry to derive
  thermodynamic parameters. Minimalist organisms with simple string-encoded
  genomes produce model ribozymes whose catalytic activity is determined by an
  ad hoc mapping between their secondary structure and the transition state
  graphs that they stabilize. Fitness is computed utilizing the ideas of
  metabolic flux analysis. We present an implementation of the complete system
  and first simulation results.CONCLUSIONS:The simulation system presented here
  allows coherent investigations into the evolutionary mechanisms of the first
  steps of metabolic evolution using a self-consistent toy universe.%

    In this paper complex adaptive systems are defined by a loop in which
  objects encode functions that act on these objects. A model for this loop is
  presented. It uses a simple recursive formal language, derived from the
  $\lambda$ calculus, to provide a semantics that maps character strings into
  functions that manipulate symbols on strings. The interaction between two
  functions, or algorithms, is defined naturally within the language through
  function compositin, and results in the production of a new function. An
  iterated map acting on sets of cuntions and a corresponding graph
  representation are defined. Their properties are useful to discuss the
  behavior of a fixed-size ensemble of randomly interacting functions. This
  "function gas," or "Turing gas," is studied under vaious conditions, and
  evolves cooperative interaction patterns of considerable intricacy. These
  patterns adapt under the influence of perturbations consisting in the addtion
  of new random functions to the system. Different organizations emerge
  depending on the availability of self-replicators.%

    In this paper we view the folding of polynucleotide (RNA) sequences as a
  map that assigns to each sequence a minimum-free-energy pattern of base
  pairings, known as secondary structure. Considering only the free energy
  leads to an energy landscape over the sequence space. Taking into account
  structure generates a less visualizable nonscalar ''landscape,'' where a
  sequence space is mapped into a space of discrete ''shapes.'' We investigate
  the statistical features of both types of landscapes by computing
  autocorrelation functions, as well as distributions of energy and structure
  distances, as a function of distance in sequence space. RNA folding is
  characterized by very short structure correlation lengths compared to the
  diameter of the sequence space. The correlation lengths depend strongly on
  the size and the pairing rules of the underlying nucleotide alphabet. Our
  data suggest that almost every minimum-free-energy structure is found within
  a small neighborhood of any random sequence. The interest in such landscapes
  results from the fact that they govern natural and artificial processes of
  optimization by mutation and selection. Simple statistical model landscapes,
  like Kauffman and Levin's n-k model [J. Theor. Biol. 128, 11 (1987)], are
  often used as a proxy for understanding realistic landscapes, like those
  induced by RNA folding. We make a detailed comparison between the energy
  landscapes derived from RNA folding and those obtained from the n-k model. We
  derive autocorrelation functions for several variants of the n-k model, and
  briefly summarize work on its fine structure. The comparison leads to an
  estimate for k = 7-8, independent of n, where n is the chain length. While
  the scaling behaviors agree, the fine structure is considerably different in
  the two cases. The reason is seen to be the extremely high frequency of
  neutral neighbors, that is, neighbors with identical energy (or structure),
  in the RNA case.%

    Artificial Life research brings together methods from Artificial
  Intelligence (AI), philosophy and biology, studying the problem of evolution
  of complexity from what we might call a constructive point of view, trying to
  replicate adaptive phenomena using computers and robots. Here we wish to shed
  new light on the issue by showing how computer-simulated evolutionary
  learning methods are capable of discovering complex emergent properties in
  complex domains. Our stance is that in AI the most interesting results come
  from the interaction between learning algorithms and real domains, leading to
  discovery of emergent properties, rather than from the algorithms themselves.
  The theory of natural selection postulates that generate-test-regenerate
  dynamics, exemplified by life on earth, when coupled with the kinds of
  environments found in the natural world, have lead to the appearance of
  complex forms. But artificial evolution methods, based on this hypothesis,
  have only begun to be put in contact with real-world environments. In the
  present thesis we explore two aspects of real-world environments as they
  interact with an evolutionary algorithm. In our first experimental domain
  (chapter 2) we show how structures can be evolved under gravitational and
  geometrical constraints, employing simulated physics. Structures evolve that
  exploit features of the interaction between brick-based structures and the
  physics of gravitational forces. In a second experimental domain (chapter 3)
  we study how a virtual world gives rise to co-adaptation between human and
  agent species. In this case we look at the competitive interaction between
  two adaptive species. The purely reactive nature of artificial agents in this
  domain implies that the high level features observed cannot be explicit in
  the genotype but rather, they emerge from the interaction between genetic
  information and a changing domain. Emergent properties, not obvious from the
  lower level description, amount to what we humans call complexity, but the
  idea stands on concepts which resist formalization -- such as difficulty or
  complicatedness. We show how simulated evolution, exploring reality, finds
  features of this kind which are preserved by selection, leading to complex
  forms and behaviors. But it does so without creating new levels of
  abstraction -- thus the question of evolution of modularity remains open.%

    Natural Selection is so ubiquitous that we never wonder how it appeared as
  the evolution rule driving Life. We usually wonder how Life appeared, and
  seldom do we make an explicit distinction between Life and natural selection.
  Here, we apply the evolution concept commonly used for studying Life to
  evolution itself. More precisely, we developed two models aiming at selecting
  among different evolution rules competing for their supremacy. We explored
  competition between acquired (AQ) versus non-acquired (NAQ) character
  inheritance. The first model is parsimonious and non-spatial, in order to
  understand relationships between environmental forcings and rule selection.
  The second model is spatially explicit and studies the adaptation differences
  between \{AQ\} and \{NAQ\} populations. We established that \{NAQ\} evolution
  rule is dominating in case of changing environment. Furthermore, we observed
  that a more adapted population better fits its environmental constraints, but
  fails in rapidly changing environments. \{NAQ\} principle and less adapted
  populations indeed act as a reservoir of traits that helps populations to
  survive in rapidly changing environments, such as the ones that probably Life
  experienced at its origins. Although perfectible, our modeling approaches
  will certainly help us to improve our understanding of origins of Life and
  Evolution, on Earth or elsewhere.%

    Sewall Wright's powerful metaphor of rugged adaptive landscapes has formed
  the basis for discussing evolution and speciation for more than 60 years.
  However, this metaphor, with its emphasis on adaptive peaks and valleys, is
  to a large degree a reflection of our three-dimensional experience. Both
  genotypes and phenotypes of biological organisms differ in numerous
  characteristics, and, thus, the dimension of 'real' adaptive landscapes is
  much larger than three. Properties of multidimensional adaptive landscapes
  are very different from those of low dimension. Consequently, something that
  is seen as a theoretical challenge in a low-dimensional case might be a
  trivial problem in a multidimensional context and vice versa, In particular,
  the problem of how a population crosses an adaptive valley on its way from
  one adaptive peak to another, which Wright attempted to solve with his
  shifting balance theory, may be non-existent. A new framework is emerging for
  deepening our understanding of evolution and speciation, which provides a
  plausible multidimensional alternative to the conventional view of rugged
  adaptive landscapes.%

    WHAT IS BEING CLAIMED? P is probability fitness 0, 1-P probability fitness
  is 1. Main prediction is that viable genotypes form 'clusters' in the
  genotype space. (Members of a cluster can be connected by a chain of viable
  single-gene substitutions) Using percolation theory (Grimmett 1989), if P is
  above a 'percolation threshold', then there is a single 'giant' component
  that includes a significant part of all viable genotypes and extends through
  the whole genotype space, and members can be connected by many evolutionary
  paths. Below this threshold, members can be connected by a single sequence of
  viable genotypes. Threshold is dramatically lowered in multidimensional
  spaces. Can generalise to rugged adaptive landscapes where fitness has a
  uniform distribution between 0 and 1, and where P is above the percolation
  threshold, showing that rugged landscapes have 'high ridges' and 'deep
  gorges' that continuously extend through genotype space. WHAT ASSUMPTIONS ARE
  MADE? 1) fitnesses are generated randomly. Commonly used, legitimate given
  current understanding of genetic basis of adaptation (at time of writing -
  might not be so convincing now) 2) fitnesses are generated independently -
  and thus landscape is 'uncorrelated'. Probably not valid biologically - model
  needs extension to 'correlated' landscapes. 3) fitnesses can take only two
  values - 0 and 1. Generalizes idea of 'good' combinations of genes, and 'bad'
  combinations. "with n diallelic loci, d=n+1 (i.e. the dimension has the order
  of the number of loci)" - stated without derivation IS THE RESEARCH DESCRIBED
  STILL CURRENT? SIGNIFICANCE - PLACE IN RESEARCH? PROBLEM THAT IS ADDRESSED?
  Based on Dobzhansky (1937) for a two-locus, two-allele population that shows
  speciation through drift. 'Rugged' adaptive landscapes have problems - do
  different species have different fitnesses? Are small differences in fitness
  important in speciation? Are local peakes attainable given mutation,
  recombination and finite population size? Does formation of a new species
  always imply a (temporary) reduction in fitness? Better alternative is
  'holey' adaptive landscapes. WHAT IS THE STRENGTH OF THE
  ASSUMPTIONS/PREMISES? Major limitation is that landscape is fixed under
  evolution, thus ignoring ecological effects/co-evolution. Correlated
  landscapes also not addressed. Focus is on mutation events, rather than
  recombination. All are major limitations. DOES THE HYPOTHESIS MAKE SPECIFIC
  PREDICTIONS? Yes: a ridge of well-fit genotypes extends through the genotype
  space. Should be a difference between rugged and holey models in the
  distribution and fitness of genotypes in the center of a hybrid zone. Given
  low-fitness of F1 hybrids (reproductive isolation is strong). Rugged: should
  also see low-fitness F1 hybrids; Holey should see other high-fitness hybrids
  other than F1 hybrids. Etc. ARE THOSE PREDICTIONS TESTABLE? WHAT TESTING HAS
  BEEN UNDERTAKEN? Yes, they are testable. Paper cites a number of studies
  providing evidence.%

    An exact method is presented for numerically calculating, within the
  framework of the stochastic formulation of chemical kinetics, the time
  evolution of any spatially homogeneous mixture of molecular species which
  interreact through a specified set of coupled chemical reaction channels. The
  method is a compact, computer-oriented, Monte Carlo simulation procedure. It
  should be particularly useful for modeling the transient behavior of
  well-mixed gas-phase systems in which many molecular species participate in
  many highly coupled chemical reactions. For ``ordinary'' chemical systems in
  which fluctuations and correlations play no significant role, the method
  stands as an alternative to the traditional procedure of numerically solving
  the deterministic reaction rate equations. For nonlinear systems near
  chemical instabilities, where fluctuations and correlations may invalidate
  the deterministic equations, the method constitutes an efficient way of
  numerically examining the predictions of the stochastic master equation.
  Although fully equivalent to the spatially homogeneous master equation, the
  numerical simulation algorithm presented here is more directly based on a
  newly defined entity called ``the reaction probability density function.''
  The purpose of this article is to describe the mechanics of the simulation
  algorithm, and to establish in a rigorous, a priori manner its physical and
  mathematical validity; numerical applications to specific chemical systems
  will be presented in subsequent publications.%

    When we simulate life, there are always more things to simulate than what
  have been coded. Life is complex and seems to have endless possibilities.
  Using artificial chemistry as a starting point to simulate life is a
  promising way to limit the possibilities because chemical reactions are
  always the same under the same physical conditions. We have built an 3D
  artificial chemistry system simulating molecules and the reactions among
  them. Our goal is to simulate a cell or a group of cells in the future using
  mainly molecules and chemical reactions. In this paper, we show that the
  system can simulate the fundamental aspects of reproduction, metabolism and
  adaptation in cells. This is accomplished by simulating reproducing
  molecules, reactions which provide energy to the reproducing molecules and
  the adaptation ability of reproducing molecules.%

    We study two measures of the complexity of heterogeneous extended systems,
  taking random Boolean networks as prototypical cases. A measure defined by
  Shalizi et al. for cellular automata, based on a criterion for optimal
  statistical prediction {[}Shalizi et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 93, 118701
  (2004)], does not distinguish between the spatial inhomogeneity of the
  ordered phase and the dynamical inhomogeneity of the disordered phase. A
  modification in which complexities of individual nodes are calculated yields
  vanishing complexity values for networks in the ordered and critical regimes
  and for highly disordered networks, peaking somewhere in the disordered
  regime. Individual nodes with high complexity are the ones that pass the most
  information from the past to the future, a quantity that depends in a
  nontrivial way on both the Boolean function of a given node and its location
  within the network.%

    Theories of the Origin of Life can be categorised as ‘template
  replication first’ and ‘metabolism first’. A key question for
  metabolism first theories is the mechanism for transfer of inherited
  information. Earlier work presented a mechanism based on catalytic cycles,
  along with supporting results from the SimSoup artificial chemistry
  simulator. The current paper presents an enhanced SimSoup model that is
  closer to real chemistry and more open ended. Molecules and the types of
  Interactions between them are constructed by the model itself using simple
  rules based on valence theory. Results of a preliminary run of the model are
  presented. Most of the Molecules produced are of a few simple types with low
  molecular weight. There is a ‘long tail’ of many low frequency Molecules,
  many of which are more complex with high molecular weight.%

    We study how correlations in the random fitness assignment may affect the
  structure of fitness landscapes, in three classes of fitness models. The
  first is a phenotype space in which individuals are characterized by a large
  number n of continuously varying traits. In a simple model of random fitness
  assignment, viable phenotypes are likely to form a giant connected cluster
  percolating throughout the phenotype space provided the viability probability
  is larger than 1/2". The second model explicitly describes genotype- to
  -phenotype and phenotype-to-fitness maps, allows for neutrality at both
  phenotype and fitness levels, and results in a fitness landscape with tunable
  correlation length. Here, phenotypic neutrality and correlation between
  fitnesses can reduce the percolation threshold, and correlations at the point
  of phase transition between local and global are most conducive to the
  formation of the giant cluster. In the third class of models, particular
  combinations of alleles or values of phenotypic characters are "incompatible"
  in the sense that the resulting genotypes or phenotypes have zero fitness.
  This setting can be viewed as a generalization of the canonical
  Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller model of speciation and is related to K-SAT
  problems, prominent in computer science. We analyze the conditions for the
  existence of viable genotypes, their number, as well as the structure and the
  number of connected clusters of viable genotypes. We show that analysis based
  on expected values can easily lead to wrong conclusions, especially when
  fitness correlations are strong. We focus on pairwise incompatibilities
  between diallelic loci, but we also address multiple alleles, complex
  incompatibilities, and continuous phenotype spaces. In the case of diallelic
  loci, the number of clusters is stochastically bounded and each cluster
  contains a very large sub-cube. Finally, we demonstrate that the discrete NK
  model shares some signature properties of models with high correlations. (C)

    A focused collection of organic synthesis reactions for computer-based
  molecule construction is presented. It is inspired by real-world chemistry
  and has been compiled in close collaboration with medicinal chemists to
  achieve high practical relevance. Virtual molecules assembled from existing
  starting material connected by these reactions are supposed to have an
  enhanced chance to be amenable to real chemical synthesis. About 50% of the
  reactions in the dataset are ring-forming reactions, which fosters the
  assembly of novel ring systems and innovative chemotypes. A comparison with a
  recent survey of the reactions used in early drug discovery revealed
  considerable overlaps with the collection presented here. The dataset is

    In the search for new bioactive compounds, there is a trend toward
  increasingly complex compound libraries aiming to target the demanding

  known bioactive molecules for human targets, indicating potential for new

    Bacteria offer an evolutionary model in which rich interactions between
  phenotype and genotype lead to compact genomes with efficient metabolic
  pathways. We seek an analogous computational process that supports a rich
  artificial heredity. These systems can be simulated by stochastic chemistry
  models, but there is currently no scope for open-ended evolution of the
  molecular species that make up the models. Instruction-set based Artifical
  Life has appropriate evolutionary properties, but the individual is
  represented as a single executing sequence with little additional physiology.
  We describe a novel combination of stochastic chemistries and evolvable
  molecule microprograms that gives a rich evolutionary framework. A single
  organism is represented by a set of exectuing sequences. Key to this approach
  is the use of inexact sequence matching for binding between individual
  molecules and for branching of molecular microprograms. We illustrate the
  approach by implementation of two steady-state replicase RNA analogues that
  demonstrate "invasion when rare".%

    This report describes in detail version 0.1 of a specification for a
  nonstandard computational model that emulates the reactivity of enzymes in
  bacterial cells. The model is an artificial chemistry in which the unique
  properties of each molecular species is encoded as a sequence of symbols. The
  model has a very simple cell-level representation consisting of a mixing
  volume and mixing equation. There is no distinction between genotype and
  pheno- type, or data and program. Randomly selected molecules are subject to
  a stochastic binding test, in which their identifying sequences are subjected
  to a complementary alignment process. If the bind is successful, the
  molecules are combined to form a computational entity to run the reaction
  between them. At this point the sequence acts as a microprogram. These
  microprograms can perform a range of tasks, much as a chemical reaction can.
  Our first chemistry within this model solves the problem of designing a
  chemical "replicase", capable of creating copies of itself such that it can
  replenish a population of molecules that are subject to a decay process. This
  report gives detail to the model, describes the replicase molecule and its
  function, and shows an 'invasion when rare' experiment.%

    WHAT IS BEING CLAIMED? Learning can be very effective in guiding
  evolutionary search; each learning trial can be almost as effective as
  producing a new organism. Without learning some forms of search are
  impossible for evolution - needle in haystack - no guidance. If search space
  is nice and smooth (hilly not rugged) then don't need learning; otherwise
  makes a difference. Baldwin effect encodes predictable changes in environment
  into genome. Different from using learning to be flexible in response to
  unpredictable changes - although that is also a good reason for learning.
  Difficulty with Lamarckian evolution - very hard to compute necessary changes
  in genome based on desired changes in phenome - computational problem. WHAT
  ASSUMPTIONS ARE MADE? That an organism can "recognise" when it has achieved
  it's goal through learning; some form of assessment of progress. IS THE
  RESEARCH DESCRIBED STILL CURRENT? SIGNIFICANCE - PLACE IN RESEARCH? PROBLEM
  THAT IS ADDRESSED? Based on Baldwin and Waddington (canalization - 1942) WHAT
  IS THE STRENGTH OF THE ASSUMPTIONS/PREMISES? DOES THE HYPOTHESIS MAKE
  SPECIFIC PREDICTIONS? ARE THOSE PREDICTIONS TESTABLE? WHAT TESTING HAS BEEN

    \field{abstract}{%
    Complex reaction systems in molecular biology are often composed of
  partially independent subsystems associated with the activity of external or
  internal triggers. Occurring as random events or dedicated physical signals,
  triggers effect transitions from one subsystem to another which might result
  in substantial changes of detectable behavior. From a modeling point of view,
  those subsystems typically differ in their reaction rules or principle of
  operation. We propose a formulation of trigger-based switching between models
  from a class of P systems with progression in time employing discretized
  mass-action kinetics. Two examples inspired by biological phenomena
  illustrate the consecutive interplay of P systems towards structural
  plasticity in reaction rules: evolutionary construction of reaction networks
  and artificial chemistries with self-reproducible subunits.%

    For computer-automated design systems to scale to complex designs they must
  be able to produce designs that exhibit the characteristics of modularity,
  regularity and hierarchy characteristics that are found both in man-made and
  natural designs. Here we claim that these characteristics are enabled by
  implementing the attributes of combination, control-flow and abstraction in
  the representation. To support this claim we use an evolutionary algorithm to
  evolve solutions to different sizes of a table design problem using five
  different representations, each with different combinations of modularity,
  regularity and hierarchy enabled and show that the best performance happens
  when all three of these attributes are enabled. We also define metrics for
  modularity, regularity and hierarchy in design encodings and demonstrate that
  high fitness values are achieved with high values of modularity, regularity
  and hierarchy and that there is a positive correlation between increases in
  fitness and increases in the measured values of modularity, regularity and
  hierarchy.%

    One of the main limitations of scalability in body-brain evolution systems
  is the representation chosen for encoding creatures. This paper defines a
  class of representations called generative representations, which are
  identified by their ability to reuse elements of the genotype in the
  translation to the phenotype. This paper presents an example of a generative
  representation for the concurrent evolution of the morphology and neural
  controller of simulated robots, and also introduces GENRE, an evolutionary
  system for evolving designs using this representation. Applying GENRE to the
  task of evolving robots for locomotion and comparing it against a
  non-generative (direct) representation shows that the generative
  representation system rapidly produces robots with significantly greater
  fitness. Analyzing these results shows that the generative representation
  system achieves better performance by capturing useful bias from the design
  space and by allowing viable large scale mutations in the phenotype.
  Generative representations thereby enable the encapsulation, coordination,
  and reuse of assemblies of parts.%

    Since typical evolutionary design systems encode only a single artifact
  with each individual, each, time the objective changes a new set of
  individuals must be evolved. When this objective varies in a way that can be
  parameterized, a more general method is to use a representation in which a
  single individual encodes an,entire class of artifacts. In addition to saving
  time by preventing the need for multiple evolutionary runs, the evolution of
  parameter-controlled designs can create families of artifacts with the same
  style and a reuse of parts between members of the family. In this paper an
  evolutionary design system is described which uses a generative
  representation to encode families of designs. Because a generative
  representation is an algorithmic encoding of a design, its input parameters
  are a way to control aspects of the design it generates. By evaluating
  individuals multiple times with different input parameters the evolutionary
  design system creates individuals in which the input parameter controls
  specific aspects of a design. This system is demonstrated on two design
  substrates: neural-networks which solve the 3/5/7-parity problem and
  three-dimensional tables of varying heights.%

    We present a novel unit of evolution: a self-reproducing cell in a
  two-dimensional artificial chemistry. The cells have a strip of genetic
  material that is used to produce enzymes, each catalyzing a specific reaction
  that may affect the survival of the cell. The enzymes are kept inside the
  cell by a loop of membrane, thus ensuring that only the cell that produced
  them gets their benefit. A set of reaction rules, each simple and local,
  allows the cells to copy their genetic information and physically divide. The
  evolutionary possibilities of the cells are explored, and it is suggested
  that the system provides a useful framework for testing hypotheses about
  self-driven evolution.%

    We describe some results submitted by users of the Organic Builder, a Java

  far beyond this and discovered several novel forms of self-replicators. When
  searching for a system with certain properties such as self-replication,
  making the system accessible to the public through a Web site is an unusual

    The adaptive value of carry-over effects, the persistence of induced
  phenotypes for several generations despite the change in the conditions that
  first induced these phenotypes, is studied in the framework of a simple
  model. Three different organismal strategies - non-inducible (genetic),
  completely inducible (plastic), and intermediate (carry-over) - are compared
  in fitness terms within three different environments. Analytical results and
  numerical simulations show that carry-over effects can have an advantage in
  stochastic environments even over organisms with high adaptive plasticity. We
  argue that carry-over effects represent an adaptive mechanism on the
  ecological timescale that fills the gap between short-term individual
  adaptations and long-term evolutionary adaptations. An extension of the
  concept of plasticity to incorporate the time dimension and include the
  stability of induced phenotypes through both clonal and sexual generations,
  is suggested.%

    The synthesis of enzymes in bacteria follows a double genetic control. The
  socalled structural genes determine the molecular organization of the
  proteins. Other, functionally specialized, genetic determinants, called
  regulator and operator genes, control the rate of protein synthesis through
  the intermediacy of cytoplasmic components or repressors. The repressors can
  be either inactivated (induction) or activated (repression) by certain
  specific metabolites. This system of regulation appears to operate directly
  at the level of the synthesis by the gene of a shortlived intermediate, or
  messenger, which becomes associated with the ribosomes where protein
  synthesis takes place.%

    In the seventies almost all models that were published in Ecological
  Modelling were either bio-geo-chemical dynamic models or population dynamic
  models. The development in ecological modelling has been toward application
  of a wider spectrum of models, as it is shown by modelling statistics. The
  new model types that have emerged, are able to offer solutions on the
  modelling problems formulated by the modelers already in the seventies.
  Today, it is possible to classify eleven types of models. An overview of

    WHAT IS BEING CLAIMED? "large, randomly connected feedback nets of binary

  systems undergo short stable cycles in the states of their constituents"
  "that the time course of these behavior cycles parallels and predicts the
  time required for cell replication in many phyla" "that the number of
  distinguishable modes of behavior of one randomly constructed net predicts
  with considerable accuracy the number of cell types in an organism which
  embodies a genetic net of the same size" "that, like cells, a randomly
  connected genetic net is capable of differentiating directly from any one
  mode of behavior to at most a few of its other modes" WHAT ASSUMPTIONS ARE
  MADE? Genes modelled as binary devices - only on or off. Some evidence that
  synthesis (of mRNA) is either all or none; limited number of repressor
  molecules per gene means seems better to treat activity as discrete rather
  than continuous Nets are random in two senses: 1) K inputs to each gene are
  chosen at random 2) effect of those inputs on genes output determined by
  selecting a random boolean function from one of 2^2^K boolean functions of
  its inputs (as no reason to suppose that elements are assigned the same
  function in living nets). Net is then fixed. IS THE RESEARCH DESCRIBED STILL
  CURRENT? SIGNIFICANCE - PLACE IN RESEARCH? PROBLEM THAT IS ADDRESSED? Walker

    \field{abstract}{%
    Understanding the genetic regulatory network comprising genes, RNA,
  proteins and the network connections and dynamical control rules among them,
  is a major task of contemporary systems biology. I focus here on the use of
  the ensemble approach to find one or more well-defined ensembles of model
  networks whose statistical features match those of real cells and organisms.
  Such ensembles should help explain and predict features of real cells and
  organisms. More precisely, an ensemble of model networks is defined by
  constraints on the "wiring diagram" of regulatory interactions, and the
  "rules" governing the dynamical behavior of regulated components of the
  network. The ensemble consists of all networks consistent with those
  constraints. Here I discuss ensembles of random Boolean networks, scale free
  Boolean networks, "medusa" Boolean networks, continuous variable networks,
  and others. For each ensemble, M statistical features, such as the size
  distribution of avalanches in gene activity changes unleashed by transiently
  altering the activity of a single gene, the distribution in distances between
  gene activities on different cell types, and others, are measured. This
  creates an M-dimensional space, where each ensemble corresponds to a cluster
  of points or distributions. Using current and future experimental techniques,
  such as gene arrays, these M properties are to be measured for real cells and
  organisms, again yielding a cluster of points or distributions in the
  M-dimensional space. The procedure then finds ensembles close to those of
  real cells and organisms, and hill climbs to attempt to match the observed M
  features. Thus obtains one or more ensembles that should predict and explain
  many features of the regulatory networks in cells and organisms.%

    Scientific theories seek to provide simple explanations for significant
  empirical regularities based on fundamental physical and mechanistic
  constraints. Biological theories have rarely reached a level of generality
  and predictive power comparable to physical theories. This discrepancy is
  explained through a combination of frozen accidents, environmental
  heterogeneity, and widespread non-linearities observed in adaptive processes.
  At the same time, model building has proven to be very successful when it
  comes to explaining and predicting the behavior of particular biological
  systems. In this respect biology resembles alternative model-rich frameworks,
  such as economics and engineering. In this paper we explore the prospects for
  general theories in biology, and suggest that these take inspiration not only
  from physics, but also from the information sciences. Future theoretical
  biology is likely to represent a hybrid of parsimonious reasoning and
  algorithmic or rule-based explanation. An open question is whether these new
  frameworks will remain transparent to human reason. In this context, we
  discuss the role of machine learning in the early stages of scientific
  discovery. We argue that evolutionary history is not only a source of
  uncertainty, but also provides the basis, through conserved traits, for very
  general explanations for biological regularities, and the prospect of unified
  theories of life. {\copyright} 2011.%

    Complex systems research is becoming ever more important in both the
  natural and social sciences. It is commonly implied that there is such a
  thing as a complex system across the disciplines. However, there is no
  concise definition of a complex system, let alone a definition that all
  disciplines agree on. We review various attempts to characterize a complex
  system, and consider a core set of features that are widely associated with
  complex systems by scientists in the field. We argue that some of these
  features are neither necessary nor sufficient for complexity, and that some
  of them are too vague or confused to be of any analytical use. In order to
  bring mathematical rigour to the issue we then review some standard measures
  of complexity from the scientific literature, and offer a taxonomy for them,
  before arguing that the one that best captures the qualitative notion of
  complexity is that of the statistical complexity. Finally, we offer our own
  list of necessary conditions as a characterization of complexity. These
  conditions are qualitative and may not be jointly sufficient for complexity.
  We close with some suggestions for future work.%

    This paper establishes a link between the challenge of solving highly
  ambitious problems in machine learning and the goal of reproducing the
  dynamics of open-ended evolution in artificial life. A major problem with the
  objective function in machine learning is that through deception it may
  actually prevent the objective from being reached. In a similar way,
  selection in evolution may sometimes act to discourage increasing complexity.
  This paper proposes a single idea that both overcomes the obstacle of
  deception and suggests a simple new approach to open-ended evolution: Instead
  of either explicitly seeking an objective or modeling a domain to capture the
  open-endedness of natural evolution, the idea is to simply search for
  novelty. Even in an objective-based problem, such novelty search ignores the
  objective and searches for behavioral novelty. Yet because many points in the
  search space collapse to the same point in behavior space, it turns out that
  the search for novelty is computationally feasible. Furthermore, because
  there are only so many simple behaviors, the search for novelty leads to
  increasing complexity. In fact, on the way up the ladder of complexity, the
  search is likely to encounter at least one solution. In this way, by
  decoupling the idea of open-ended search from only artificial life worlds,
  the raw search for novelty can be applied to real world problems.
  Counterintuitively, in the deceptive maze navigation task in this paper,
  novelty search significantly outperforms objective-based search, suggesting a
  surprising new approach to machine learning.%

    A coevolutionary model is discussed that incorporates the logical structure
  of constitutional chemistry and its kinetics on the one hand and the
  topological evolution of the chemical reaction network on the other hand. The
  motivation for designing this model is twofold. First, experiments that are
  to provide insight into chemical problems should be expressed in a syntax
  that remains as close as possible to real chemistry. Second, the study of
  physical properties of the complex chemical reaction networks requires
  growing models that incorporate features realistic from a biochemical
  perspective. In this article the theory and algorithms underlying the
  coevolutionary model are explained, and two illustrative examples are
  provided. These examples show that one needs to be careful in making general
  claims concerning the structure of chemical reaction networks.%

    An RNA enzyme that catalyzes the RNA-templated joining of RNA was converted
  to a format whereby two enzymes catalyze each other's synthesis from a total
  of four oligonucleotide substrates. These cross-replicating RNA enzymes
  undergo self-sustained exponential amplification in the absence of proteins
  or other biological materials. Amplification occurs with a doubling time of
  about 1 hour and can be continued indefinitely. Populations of various
  cross-replicating enzymes were constructed and allowed to compete for a
  common pool of substrates, during which recombinant replicators arose and
  grew to dominate the population. These replicating RNA enzymes can serve as
  an experimental model of a genetic system. Many such model systems could be
  constructed, allowing different selective outcomes to be related to the
  underlying properties of the genetic system.%

    A simple artificial chemistry for the Squirm3 artificial environment,
  consisting of replicators that produce quasi-universal enzymes, is presented.
  The aim of this system is twofold: first, to demonstrate the survival of
  extracellular replicators despite the presence of faster-replicating
  parasites; second, to observe the evolution of adaptively useful enzymes.
  Accomplishing these goals will underpin future attempts to attain open-ended
  and/or creative evolution in the Squirm3 environment. The first aim is
  achieved by attaching enzymes to their replicators. Our software
  implementation demonstrates replicators with 10 bases prospering in the
  presence of parasites with zero bases. To accomplish the second aim, a
  process for creating selection pressure toward longer molecules is
  introduced. The evolution and subsequent dominance of a replicator that
  produces an adaptively useful enzyme is demonstrated experimentally. Finally,
  we comment on the crucial role played by neutral evolution and discuss the
  biological significance of our results.%

    Historically, a great many features of organisms have been said to show a
  trend over the history of life, and many rationales for such trends have been
  proposed. Here I review eight candidates, eight "live hypotheses" that are
  inspiring research on largest-scale trends today: entropy, energy
  intensiveness, evolutionary versatility, developmental depth, structural
  depth, adaptedness, size, and complexity. For each, the review covers the
  principal arguments that have been advanced for why a trend is expected, as
  well as some of the empirical approaches that have been adopted. Also
  discussed are three conceptual matters arising in connection with trend
  studies: 1. Alternative bases for classifying trends: pattern versus
  dynamics; 2. alternative modes in which largest-scale trends have been
  studied: "exploratory" versus "skeptical"; and 3. evolutionary progress.%

    Evolution is notorious for its creative power, but also for giving rise to
  complex, unpredictable dynamics. As a result, practitioners of artificial
  evolution have encountered difficulties in predicting, analysing, or even
  understanding the outcome of their experiments. In particular, the concept of
  evolutionary "progress" (whether in the sense of performance increase or
  complexity growth) has given rise to much debate and confusion. After a
  careful description of the mechanisms of evolution and natural selection, we
  provide usable concepts of performance and progress in coevolution. In
  particular, we introduce a distinction between three types of progress:
  local, historical, and global, which we suggest underlies much of the
  confusion that surrounds coevolutionary dynamics. Similarly, we provide a
  comprehensive answer to the ques- tion of whether an "arrow of complexity"
  exists in evolution. We introduce several methods to detect and analyse
  performance and progress in coevolutionary experiments. We propose a sta-
  tistical measure (Fitness Transmission) to detect the presence of adaptive
  Darwinian evolution in a reproducing population, based solely on genealogic
  records; we also point out the limitations of a popular method (the
  Bedau-Packard statistics of evolutionary activity) for this purpose. To test
  and illustrate our results, we implement a rich experimental system, inspired
  by the seminal work of Karl Sims, in which virtual creatures can evolve and
  interact under various conditions in a physically realistic three-dimensional
  (3D) environment. To our knowledge, this is the first complete
  reimplementation and extension of Sims' results. We later extend this system
  with the introduction of physical combat between creatures, also a first.
  Finally, we introduce Evosphere, an open, planet-like environment in which 3D
  artificial creatures interact, reproduce and evolve freely. We conclude our
  discussion by using Fitness Transmission to detect the onset of adaptive
  evolution in this system.%

    A method for evolving a developmental program inside a cell to create
  multicellular organisms of arbitrary size and characteristics is described.
  The cell genotype is evolved so that the organism will organize itself into
  well defined patterns of differentiated cell types (e.g. the French Flag). In
  addition the cell genotypes are evolved to respond appropriately to
  environmental signals that cause metamorphosis of the whole organism. A

    Metazoan life cycles can be complex in different ways. A number of diverse
  phenotypes and reproductive events can sequentially occur along the cycle,
  and at certain stages a variety of developmental and reproductive options can
  be available to the animal, the choice among which depends on a combination
  of organismal and environmental conditions.We hypothesize that a diversity of
  phenotypes arranged in developmental sequence throughout an animal's life
  cycle may have evolved by genetic assimilation of alternative phenotypes
  originally triggered by environmental cues.This is supported by similarities
  between the developmental mechanisms mediating phenotype change and
  alternative phenotype determination during ontogeny and the common ecological
  condition that favour both forms of phenotypic variation.The comparison of
  transcription profiles from different developmental stages throughout a
  complex life cycle with those from alternative phenotypes in closely related
  polyphenic animals is expected to offer critical evidence upon which to
  evaluate our hypothesis.%

    We want to implement a variety of computer programs capable of generating
  unbounded novelty via emergent evolution. We also want a principled,
  structured way of analysing our novelty-generation programs and improving
  them over time. We have developed a definition of embodiment in terms of a
  conceptual framework of hierarchical phenomena, mechanisms, and worlds, for
  use in analysing and building novelty-generation programs. We present these
  concepts and demonstrate them on two existing artificial chemistry systems:
  Stringmol and GraphMol. Our two demonstration systems behave in very
  different ways. We describe these differences, explaining why they arise in
  terms of our framework. The systems better able to generate novelty have more

    Drug discovery and development is a complex, lengthy process, and failure
  of a candidate molecule can occur as a result of a combination of reasons,
  such as poor pharmacokinetics, lack of efficacy, or toxicity. Successful drug
  candidates necessarily represent a compromise between the numerous, sometimes
  competing objectives so that the benefits to patients outweigh potential
  drawbacks and risks. De novo drug design involves searching an immense space
  of feasible, druglike molecules to select those with the highest chances of
  becoming drugs using computational technology. Traditionally, de novo design
  has focused on designing molecules satisfying a single objective, such as
  similarity to a known ligand or an interaction score, and ignored the
  presence of the multiple objectives required for druglike behavior. Recently,
  methods have appeared in the literature that attempt to design molecules
  satisfying multiple predefined objectives and thereby produce candidate
  solutions with a higher chance of serving as viable drug leads. This paper
  describes the Multiobjective Evolutionary Graph Algorithm (MEGA), a new
  multiobjective optimization de novo design algorithmic framework that can be
  used to design structurally diverse molecules satisfying one or more
  objectives. The algorithm combines evolutionary techniques with graph-theory
  to directly manipulate graphs and perform an efficient global search for
  promising solutions. In the Experimental Section we present results from the
  application of MEGA for designing molecules that selectively bind to a known
  pharmaceutical target using the ChillScore interaction score family. The
  primary constraints applied to the design are based on the identified
  structure of the protein target and a known ligand currently marketed as a
  drug. A detailed explanation of the key elements of the specific
  implementation of the algorithm is given, including the methods for obtaining
  molecular building blocks, evolving the chemical graphs, and scoring the
  designed molecules. Our findings demonstrate that MEGA can produce
  structurally diverse candidate molecules representing a wide range of
  compromises of the supplied constraints and thus can be used as an "idea
  generator" to support expert chemists assigned with the task of molecular
  design. {\~{A}}{\^{A}}$\neg${\copyright} 2009 American Chemical Society.%

    Contemporary software systems are exposed to demanding, dynamic, and
  unpredictable environments where the traditional adaptability mechanisms may
  not be sufficient. To imitate and fully benefit from life-like adaptability
  in software systems that might come closer to the complexity levels of
  biological organisms, we seek a formal mathematical model of certain
  fundamental concepts such as: life, organism, evolvability and adaptation. In
  this work we concentrate on the concept of software evolvability. Our work
  proposes an evolutionary computation model, based on the theory of
  hypercycles and autopoiesis. The intrinsic properties of hypercycles allow
  them to evolve into higher levels of complexity, analogous to multi-level, or
  hierarchical evolutionary processes. We aim to obtain structures of
  self-maintaining ensembles, that are hierarchically organised, and our
  primary focus is on such open-ended hierarchically organised evolution.%

    Recent advances in molecular genetics have had a great deal of influence on
  evolutionary theory, and in particular, the neutral mutation-random drift
  hypothesis of molecular evolution1,2 has stimulated much interest. The
  concept of neutral mutant substitution in the population by random genetic
  drift can be extended to include random fixation of very slightly deleterious
  mutations which have more chance of being selected against than of being
  selected for3,4. If this class of mutant substitution is important, we can
  predict that the evolution is rapid in small populations or at the time of
  speciation. Here I shall organize the observed facts which indicate that this

    The nearly neutral theory contends that the interaction of drift and
  selection is important and occurs at various levels, including synonymous and
  nonsynonymous substitutions in protein coding regions and sequence turnover
  of regulatory elements. Recent progress of the theory is reviewed, and the
  interaction between drift and selection is suggested to differ at these
  different levels. Weak selective force on synonymous changes is stable,
  whereas its consequence on nonsynonymous changes depends on environmental
  factors. Selection on differentiation of regulatory elements is even more
  dependent on environmental factors than on amino acid changes. Of particular
  significance is the role of drift in the evolution of gene regulation that
  directly participates in morphological evolution. The range of near
  neutrality depends on the effective size of the population that is influenced
  by selected linked loci. In addition to the effective population size,
  molecular chaperones such as heat shock protein 90 have significant effects
  on the range of near neutrality.%

    A short history of the major features of neutral theories of molecular
  evolution is presented. Emphasis is placed on the nearly neutral theory, as
  this version of the neutral theory has explained the widest range of
  phenomena. The shift of interest from protein to DNA evolution is chronicled,
  leading to the modern view that silent and replacement substitutions are
  responding to different evolutionary forces. However, the exact nature and
  magnitude of these forces remains controversial, as all current theoretical
  models suffer either from assumptions that are not quite realistic or from an
  inability to account readily for all phenomena. Although the gathering of
  sequence data has been the main effort of contemporary population genetics,
  further exploration of theoretical models of molecular evolution would
  provide a more coherent framework for data analysis.%

    Living cells must maintain their membranes by active metabolism. The
  membrane is not static but a dynamic structure that has evolved along with
  its internal reactions. When we reflect on the emergence and evolution of
  primitive cells, we should not forget the mutual dependency between membranes
  and metabolic cycles inside the cell. In this paper, we present a simple
  abstract model of the self-maintaining cell. A metabolic cycle will produce a
  self-assembling membrane that will enclose the metabolic cycle. We show that
  a self-maintaining cell has the potential to reproduce itself spontaneously.
  Further, we have demonstrated two different ways of cellular reproduction
  depending on the mobility of chemicals. In the first case, a cell releases
  autocatalytic chemicals that create new cells outside the mother cell. In the
  second case, a cell grows larger and divides itself into daughter cells by
  creating a new internal dividing membrane.%

    Horizontal transfer (HT) is central to the evolution of prokaryotic
  species. Selfish and mobile genetic elements, such as phages, plasmids, and
  transposons, are the primary vehicles for HT among prokaryotes. In
  multicellular eukaryotes, the prevalence and evolutionary significance of HT
  remain unclear. Here, we identified a set of DNA transposon families dubbed
  ACE VADERS (or ) whose consensus sequences are
  {\^a}{\~{A}}{\textcent}{\^{A}}{\^{A}}$\deg${\~{A}}{\^{A}}96% identical
  over their entire length (2.9 kb) in the genomes of murine rodents
  (rat/mouse), bushbaby (prosimian primate), little brown bat
  (laurasiatherian), tenrec (afrotherian), opossum (marsupial), and two
  non-mammalian tetrapods (anole lizard and African clawed frog). In contrast,
  elements were undetectable in other species represented in the sequence
  databases, including 19 other mammals with draft whole-genome assemblies.
  This patchy distribution, coupled with the extreme level of identity in
  widely divergent tetrapods and the overall lack of selective constraint
  acting on these elements, is incompatible with vertical inheritance, but
  strongly indicative of multiple horizontal introductions. We show that these
  germline infiltrations likely occurred around the same evolutionary time
  (15{\^a}{\~{A}}{\textcent}{\^{A}}{\^{A}}$\neg$``46 mya) and spawned some of
  the largest bursts of DNA transposon activity ever recorded in any species
  lineage (nearly 100,000 copies per haploid genome in tenrec). The process
  also led to the emergence of a new gene in the murine lineage derived from a
  transposase. In summary, HT of DNA transposons has contributed significantly
  to shaping and diversifying the genomes of multiple mammalian and tetrapod
  species.%

    A large body of research has investigated the advantages of combining
  phenotype adaptation and genotype adaptation. The hybridization of genetic
  search and local search methods, often known as memetic algorithms, and the
  influence of learning on evolution, i.e., the Baldwin effect and the Hiding
  effect, have been widely studied. However, most work assumes a stationary
  environment, and thus overlooks potentially advantages or disadvantages that
  can arise from phenotype plasticity only in changing environments. We show
  that a process with two levels of adaptation allows the system to operate on
  two different levels of diversity at the same time, which can be of great
  advantage under certain environmental conditions.%

    Using a simple simulation model of evolution and learning, this paper
  provides an evolutionary argument why Lamarckian inheritance - the direct
  transfer of lifetime learning from parent to offspring - may be so rare in
  nature. Lamarckian inheritance allows quicker genetic adaptation to new
  environmental conditions than non-lamarckian inheritance. While this may be
  an advantage in the short term, it may be detrimental in the long term, since
  the population may be less well prepared for future environmental changes
  than in the absence of Lamarckianism.%

    Abstract The theory of population genetics and evolutionary computation
  have been evolving separately for nearly 30 years. Many results have been
  independently obtained in both fields and many others are unique to its
  respective field. We aim to bridge this gap by developing a unifying
  framework for evolutionary processes that allows both evolutionary algorithms
  and population genetics models to be cast in the same formal framework. The
  framework we present here decomposes the evolutionary process into its
  several components in order to facilitate the identification of similarities
  between different models. In particular, we propose a classification of
  evolutionary operators based on the defining properties of the different
  components. We cast several commonly used operators from both fields into
  this common framework. Using this, we map different evolutionary and genetic
  algorithms to different evolutionary regimes and identify candidates with the
  most potential for the translation of results between the fields. This
  provides a unified description of evolutionary processes and represents a
  stepping stone towards new tools and results to both fields.%

    Amoeba is a computer model designed to facilitate the study of the origin
  and evolution of digital life. Specifically, an initially disordered system,
  consisting of random sequences of machine instructions, self-organizes into
  an ordered system containing self-replicating programs. The current version
  of Amoeba broadens the original system's capability by using a basis set of
  32 machine instructions that is computationally universal. In addition,
  Amoeba uses a set of 64 address labels, each of which is randomly assigned to
  a machine instruction each time a sequence is randomly created. This
  eliminates the constraint that occurs when the complements of predefined
  codons are used for addressing. A more open-ended system results because
  programs can now form subroutines that are arranged in an arbitrary manner.%

    A sudden transition in a system from an inanimate state to the living
  state{\textemdash}defined on the basis of present day living
  organisms{\textemdash}would constitute a highly unlikely event hardly
  predictable from physical laws. From this uncontroversial idea, a
  self-consistent representation of the origin of life process is built up,
  which is based on the possibility of a series of intermediate stages. This
  approach requires a particular kind of stability for these
  stages{\textemdash}dynamic kinetic stability (DKS){\textemdash}which is not
  usually observed in regular chemistry, and which is reflected in the
  persistence of entities capable of self-reproduction. The necessary
  connection of this kinetic behaviour with far-from-equilibrium thermodynamic
  conditions is emphasized and this leads to an evolutionary view for the
  origin of life in which multiplying entities must be associated with the
  dissipation of free energy. Any kind of entity involved in this process has
  to pay the energetic cost of irreversibility, but, by doing so, the
  contingent emergence of new functions is made feasible. The consequences of
  these views on the studies of processes by which life can emerge are
  inferred.%

    Background: A software engineering systematic map is a defined method to
  build a classification scheme and structure a software engineering field of
  interest. The analysis of results focuses on frequencies of publications for
  categories within the scheme. Thereby, the coverage of the research field can
  be determined. Different facets of the scheme can also be combined to answer
  more specific research questions. Objective: We describe how to conduct a
  systematic mapping study in software engineering and provide guidelines. We
  also compare systematic maps and systematic reviews to clarify how to chose
  between them. This comparison leads to a set of guidelines for systematic
  maps. Method: We have defined a systematic mapping process and applied it to
  complete a systematic mapping study. Furthermore, we compare systematic maps
  with systematic reviews by systematically analyzing existing systematic
  reviews. Results: We describe a process for software engineering systematic
  mapping studies and compare it to systematic reviews. Based on this,
  guidelines for conducting systematic maps are defined. Conclusions:
  Systematic maps and reviews are different in terms of goals, breadth,
  validity issues and implications. Thus, they should be used complementarily
  and require different methods (e.g., for analysis).%

    At some stage in the origin of life, an informational polymer must have
  arisen by purely chemical means. According to one version of the `RNA world'
  hypothesis(1-3) this polymer was RNA, but attempts to provide experimental
  support for this have failed(4,5). In particular, although there has been
  some success demonstrating that `activated' ribonucleotides can polymerize to
  form RNA(6,7), it is far from obvious how such ribonucleotides could have
  formed from their constituent parts ( ribose and nucleobases). Ribose is
  difficult to form selectively(8,9), and the addition of nucleobases to ribose
  is inefficient in the case of purines(10) and does not occur at all in the
  case of the canonical pyrimidines(11). Here we show that activated pyrimidine
  ribonucleotides can be formed in a short sequence that bypasses free ribose
  and the nucleobases, and instead proceeds through arabinose amino-oxazoline
  and anhydronucleoside intermediates. The starting materials for the
  synthesis-cyanamide, cyanoacetylene, glycolaldehyde, glyceraldehyde and
  inorganic phosphate-are plausible prebiotic feedstock molecules(12-15), and
  the conditions of the synthesis are consistent with potential early-Earth
  geochemical models. Although inorganic phosphate is only incorporated into
  the nucleotides at a late stage of the sequence, its presence from the start
  is essential as it controls three reactions in the earlier stages by acting
  as a general acid/base catalyst, a nucleophilic catalyst, a pH buffer and a
  chemical buffer. For prebiotic reaction sequences, our results highlight the
  importance of working with mixed chemical systems in which reactants for a
  particular reaction step can also control other steps.%

    Complex Systems Science aims to understand concepts like complexity,
  self-organization, emergence and adaptation, among others. The inherent
  fuzziness in complex systems definitions is complicated by the unclear
  relation among these central processes: does self-organisation emerge or does
  it set the preconditions for emergence? Does complexity arise by adaptation
  or is complexity necessary for adaptation to arise? The inevitable
  consequence of the current impasse is miscommunication among scientists
  within and across disciplines. We propose a set of concepts, together with
  their possible information-theoretic interpretations, which can be used to
  facilitate the Complex Systems Science discourse. Our hope is that the
  suggested information-theoretic baseline may promote consistent
  communications among practitioners, and provide new insights into the field.

    The origin of life (OOL) problem remains one of the more challenging
  scientific questions of all time. In this essay, we propose that following
  recent experimental and theoretical advances in systems chemistry, the
  underlying principle governing the emergence of life on the Earth can in its
  broadest sense be specified, and may be stated as follows: all stable
  (persistent) replicating systems will tend to evolve over time towards
  systems of greater stability. The stability kind referred to, however, is
  dynamic kinetic stability, and quite distinct from the traditional
  thermodynamic stability which conventionally dominates physical and chemical
  thinking. Significantly, that stability kind is generally found to be
  enhanced by increasing complexification, since added features in the
  replicating system that improve replication efficiency will be reproduced,
  thereby offering an explanation for the emergence of life{\textquoteright}s
  extraordinary complexity. On the basis of that simple principle, a
  fundamental reassessment of the underlying chemistry{\textendash}biology
  relationship is possible, one with broad ramifications. In the context of the
  OOL question, this novel perspective can assist in clarifying central
  ahistoric aspects of abiogenesis, as opposed to the many historic aspects
  that have probably been forever lost in the mists of time.%

    Understanding the genetic and molecular mechanisms governing the evolution
  of morphology is a major challenge in biology. Because most animals share a
  conserved repertoire of body-building and -patterning genes, morphological
  diversity appears to evolve primarily through changes in the deployment of
  these genes during development. The complex expression patterns of
  developmentally regulated genes are typically controlled by numerous
  independent cis-regulatory elements (CREs). It has been proposed that
  morphological evolution relies predominantly on changes in the architecture
  of gene regulatory networks and in particular on functional changes within
  CREs. Here, we discuss recent experimental studies that support this
  hypothesis and reveal some unanticipated features of how regulatory evolution
  occurs. From this growing body of evidence, we identify three key operating
  principles underlying regulatory evolution, that is, how regulatory
  evolution: () uses available genetic components in the form of preexisting
  and active transcription factors and CREs to generate novelty; () minimizes
  the penalty to overall fitness by introducing discrete changes in gene
  expression; and () allows interactions to arise among any transcription
  factor and downstream CRE. These principles endow regulatory evolution with a
  vast creative potential that accounts for both relatively modest
  morphological differences among closely related species and more profound
  anatomical divergences among groups at higher taxonomical levels.%

    Biochemical networks are used in computational biology, to model
  mechanistic details of systems involved in cell signaling, metabolism, and
  regulation of gene expression. Parametric and structural uncertainty, as well
  as combinatorial explosion are strong obstacles against analyzing the
  dynamics of large models of this type. Multiscaleness, an important property
  of these networks, can be used to get past some of these obstacles. Networks
  with many well separated time scales, can be reduced to simpler models, in a
  way that depends only on the orders of magnitude and not on the exact values
  of the kinetic parameters. The main idea used for such robust simplifications
  of networks is the concept of dominance among model elements, allowing
  hierarchical organization of these elements according to their effects on the
  network dynamics. This concept finds a natural formulation in tropical
  geometry. We revisit, in the light of these new ideas, the main approaches to
  model reduction of reaction networks, such as quasi-steady state (QSS) and
  quasi-equilibrium approximations (QE), and provide practical recipes for
  model reduction of linear and non-linear networks. We also discuss the
  application of model reduction to the problem of parameter identification,
  via backward pruning machine learning techniques.%

    The papers in this theme issue of Philosophical Transactions B present
  important perspectives on the origin and evolution of genomes. Key questions
  include genome beginnings: what preceded genomes? How were the first genomes
  organized, and according to what principles, by what mechanisms and along
  what paths did they begin to diversify? Our expert contributors explore
  genome diversity-among the deepest lineages, and from the highest taxon
  levels to intriguing individual species-discussing the processes that have
  shaped, and continue to shape, genomes of bacteria, archaebacteria and
  eukaryotes. A major theme is lateral (horizontal) genetic transmission, some
  (perhaps much) of which involves the abundant small elements that pervade the
  biosphere-viruses, plasmids, gene transfer agents-that can not only shuttle
  DNA among cellular organisms but also modify it in the process. Do the
  frequency and impact of lateral transfers on (many) genomes render the tree
  of life only an approximation-useful in some contexts, less so in others-or
  indeed is the tree of life paradigm now a barrier to a richer, more
  integrative understanding of life on Earth? We have grouped these papers to
  reflect the chronology and significant evolutionary events in the origin and
  evolution of genomes. The emerging narrative is fresh with competing concepts
  and theories. In other words, in the field of genome evolution, the
  scientific process is alive and healthy.%

    We have developed an artificial chemistry in the computer core, where one
  is able to evolve assembler-automaton code without any predefined

  communicate locally, and the system is continuously subjected to noise. The
  system also has a notion of local computational resources. We see different
  evolutionary paths depending on the specified parameters and the level of
  complexity, measured as distance from initially randomized core. For several
  initial conditions the system is able to develop extremely viable cooperative
  structures (organisms?) which totally dominate the core. We have been able to

    Biological development is a stunning mechanism that allows robust
  generation of complex structures from a linear building plan. This makes it
  an interesting source of inspiration for solving problems where direct
  manipulation of a higher-order structure is hard, and the generative building
  plan can be used as a substitute for indirect manipulation of the unfolded
  structure. In this paper we propose CA-DEV as a simple computational model
  for development of rules for non-uniform 2D cellular automata. While being a
  simplified version of more complex bio-inspired models, CA-DEV incorporates
  both lineage and induction, and is easily combined with artificial evolution
  through a binary genotype. We report a number of basic experiments in
  evolving genotypes for CA-DEV with different settings related to cell
  division and induction. These experiments show that while the power to
  introduce diversity is high with most settings, structural properties of
  developed phenotypes are of a different nature depending on the properties of
  the development adopted.%

    With a gene required for each phenotypic trait, direct genetic encodings
  may show poor scalability to increasing phenotype length. Developmental
  systems may alleviate this problem by providing more efficient indirect
  genotype to phenotype mappings. A novel classification of multi-cellular
  developmental systems in evolvable hardware is introduced. It shows a
  category of developmental systems that up to now has rarely been explored. We
  argue that this category is where most of the benefits of developmental
  systems lie (e.g. speed, scalability, robustness, inter-cellular and
  environmental interactions that allow fault-tolerance or adaptivity). This
  article describes a very simple genetic encoding and developmental system
  designed for multi-cellular circuits that belongs to this category. We refer
  to it as the morphogenetic system. The morphogenetic system is inspired by
  gene expression and cellular differentiation. It focuses on low computational
  requirements which allows fast execution and a compact hardware
  implementation. The morphogenetic system shows better scalability compared to
  a direct genetic encoding in the evolution of structures of differentiated
  cells, and its dynamics provides fault-tolerance up to high fault rates. It
  outperforms a direct genetic encoding when evolving spiking neural networks
  for pattern recognition and robot navigation. The results obtained with the
  morphogenetic system indicate that this ``minimalist'' approach to
  developmental systems merits further study.%

    Evolutionary algorithms that use embryogenesis in the creation of
  individuals have several desirable qualities. Such algorithms are able to
  create complex, modular designs which can scale well to large problems.
  However, the inner workings of developmental algorithms have not been
  investigated as thoroughly as their direct-encoding counterparts. More
  precisely, it would be beneficial to look at how the rules used during
  embryogenesis evolve alongside the phenotypes they produced. This paper
  reports on such an investigation into the evolution of a rule set for the
  growth of an artificial neural network, and identifies several aspects that
  are desirable for the genomes of a developmental evolutionary algorithm.%

    In this paper, we study the relationship between learning and evolution in
  a simple abstract model, where neural networks capable of learning are
  evolved using genetic algorithms (GAs). Each individual tries to acquire a
  proper behavior under a given environment through its lifetime learning, and
  the best individuals are selected to reproduce offspring, which then conduct
  lifetime learning in the succeeding generation. The connective weights of
  individuals' neural networks undergo modification, i.e., certain characters
  will be acquired, through their lifetime learning. By setting various rates
  for the heritability of acquired characters, which control the strength of
  `Lamarckian' strategy, we observe adaptational processes of populations over
  successive generations. By taking the degree of environmental changes into
  consideration, we show the following results. Under static environments,
  populations with higher rates of heritability adapt themselves more quickly
  toward the environments, and thus perform well. On the other hand, under
  nonstationary environments, populations with lower rates of heritability not
  only show more stable behavior against environmental changes, but also
  maintain greater adaptability with respect to such changing environments.
  Consequently, the population with zero heritability, i.e., the Darwinian
  population, attains the highest level of adaptation towards dynamic
  environments.%

    Daisyworld is a model dynamical system in which very simple mechanisms
  interact to produce complex behaviour. It was devised to show how regulation
  can arise without natural selection. Here we investigate the model in greater
  detail. We analyse the possible steady states and study the response of the
  system under different conditions, we consider the implications of the
  hysteresis which is found in this and many other non-linear systems, and we
  compare the properties of the model with those of systems that evolved solely
  by natural selection. Natural selection inherently concentrates on local
  optimization and immediate advantage rather than on robustness and long-term
  benefit. This makes some features of organisms hard to explain within the
  synthetic theory. The model suggests that the solution may simply be that
  natural selection was not the crucial factor in their evolution. When a
  system that has previously responded to challenge counter-intuitively or
  apparently not at all subsequently begins to react in the way one would
  expect, this should be taken as a warning that it is a regulated system and
  that the regulation may be about to break down. If that happens, there is
  likely to be a catastrophic change as the system either collapses altogether
  or else moves rapidly to the state it would have been in without regulation.
  Recovery, if possible at all, is likely to be unexpectedly difficult.%

    Evolution is a highly complex multilevel process and mathematical modeling
  of evolutionary phenomenon requires proper abstraction and radical reduction
  to essential features. Examples are natural selection, Mendel's laws of
  inheritance, optimization by mutation and selection, and neutral evolution.
  An attempt is made to describe the roots of evolutionary theory in
  mathematical terms. Evolution can be studied in vitro outside cells with
  polynucleotide molecules. Replication and mutation are visualized as chemical
  reactions that can be resolved, analyzed, and modeled at the molecular level,
  and straightforward extension eventually results in a theory of evolution
  based upon biochemical kinetics. Error propagation in replication commonly
  results in an error threshold that provides an upper bound for mutation
  rates. Appearance and sharpness of the error threshold depend on the fitness
  landscape , being the distribution of fitness values in genotype or sequence
  space . In molecular terms, fitness landscapes are the results of two
  consecutive mappings from sequences into structures and from structures into
  the (nonnegative) real numbers. Some properties of genotype-phenotype maps
  are illustrated well by means of sequence-structure relations of RNA
  molecules. Neutrality in the sense that many RNA sequences form the same
  (coarse grained) structure is one of these properties, and characteristic for
  such mappings. Evolution cannot be fully understood without considering
  fluctuations-each mutant originates form a single copy, after all. The
  existence of neutral sets of genotypes called neutral networks , in
  particular, necessitates stochastic modeling, which is introduced here by
  simulation of molecular evolution in a kind of flowreactor.%

    Many networks are important because they are substrates for dynamical
  systems, and their pattern of functional connectivity can itself be dynamic -
  they can functionally reorganize, even if their underlying anatomical
  structure remains fixed. However, the recent rapid progress in discovering
  the community structure of networks has overwhelmingly focused on that
  constant anatomical connectivity. In this paper, we lay out the problem of
  discovering functional communities, and describe an approach to doing so.
  This method combines recent work on measuring information sharing across
  stochastic networks with an existing and successful community-discovery
  algorithm for weighted networks. We illustrate it with an application to a
  large biophysical model of the transition from beta to gamma rhythms in the
  hippocampus.%

    Most species maintain abundant genetic variation and experience a range of
  environmental conditions, yet phenotypic variation is low. That is,
  development is robust to changes in genotype and environment. It has been
  claimed that this robustness, termed canalization, evolves because of
  long-term natural selection for optimal phenotypes. We show that the
  developmental process, here modeled as a network of interacting
  transcriptional regulators, constrains the genetic system to produce
  canalization, even without selection toward an optimum. The extent of
  canalization, measured as the insensitivity to mutation of a network's
  equilibrium state, depends on the complexity of the network, such that more
  highly connected networks evolve to be more canalized. We argue that
  canalization may be an inevitable consequence of complex
  developmental-genetic processes and thus requires no explanation in terms of
  evolution to suppress phenotypic variation.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    A major challenge for evolutionary computation is to evolve phenotypes such
  as neural networks, sensory systems, or motor controllers at the same level
  of complexity as found in biological organisms. In order to meet this
  challenge, many researchers are proposing indirect encodings, that is,
  evolutionary mechanisms where the same genes are used multiple times in the
  process of building a phenotype. Such gene reuse allows compact
  representations of very complex phenotypes. Development is a natural choice
  for implementing indirect encodings, if only because nature itself uses this
  very process. Motivated by the development of embryos in nature, we define
  artificial embryogeny (AE) as the subdiscipline of evolutionary computation
  (EC) in which phenotypes undergo a developmental phase. An increasing number
  of AE systems are currently being developed, and a need has arisen for a
  principled approach to comparing and contrasting, and ultimately building,
  such systems. Thus, in this paper, we develop a principled taxonomy for AE.
  This taxonomy provides a unified context for long-term research in AE, so
  that implementation decisions can be compared and contrasted along known
  dimensions in the design space of embryogenic systems. It also allows
  predicting how the settings of various AE parameters affect the capacity to
  efficiently evolve complex phenotypes.%

    Abstract Self-sustaining autocatalytic chemical networks represent a
  necessary, though not sufficient condition for the emergence of early living
  systems. These networks have been formalised and investigated within the
  framework of \{RAF\} theory, which has led to a number of insights and
  results concerning the likelihood of such networks forming. In this paper, we
  extend this analysis by focussing on how small autocatalytic networks are
  likely to be when they first emerge. First we show that simulations are
  unlikely to settle this question, by establishing that the problem of finding
  a smallest \{RAF\} within a catalytic reaction system is NP-hard. However,
  irreducible \{RAFs\} (irrRAFs) can be constructed in polynomial time, and we
  show it is possible to determine in polynomial time whether a bounded size
  set of these irrRAFs contain the smallest \{RAFs\} within a system. Moreover,
  we derive rigorous bounds on the sizes of small \{RAFs\} and use simulations
  to sample irrRAFs under the binary polymer model. We then apply mathematical
  arguments to prove a new result suggested by those simulations: at the
  transition catalysis level at which \{RAFs\} first form in this model, small
  \{RAFs\} are unlikely to be present. We also investigate further the
  relationship between \{RAFs\} and another formal approach to self-sustaining
  and closed chemical networks, namely chemical organisation theory (COT).%

    Network artificial chemistry (NAC) is an approach to emulating molecular
  interaction in a solvent with a mathematical graph. To emulate molecules'
  spatial movement in a 3D space, we have to appropriately design rewiring
  rules for the NAC's weakest edges (van der Waals edges) so that the edges
  imitate the contact relation between molecules or atomic clusters. The paper
  presents one candidate solution for this problem. First, an energy function
  of network is introduced, and a rewiring rule is formulated using the
  criterion of the minimization of the energy. The energy consists of the node
  degree's diversity term and the second shortest path term, and its
  minimization makes a network have topological properties of a regular graph.
  Second, we conduct a NAC simulation using the established rewiring rule and
  compare the results with those of a random walk simulation that emulates
  Brownian motion of hard spheres in a 3D Euclid space. It is shown that the
  two experimental results are in good agreement with each other in terms of
  such network properties as the cluster coefficient and average path length or
  the joining and cutting probabilities of edges.%

  a result of computer simulations, it has been found that different membrane

    \field{abstract}{%
    Replicators are fundamental to the origin of life and evolvability. Their
  survival depends on the accuracy of replication and the efficiency of growth
  relative to spontaneous decay. Infrabiological systems are built of two
  coupled autocatalytic systems, in contrast to minimal living systems that
  must comprise at least a metabolic subsystem, a hereditary subsystem and a
  boundary, serving respective functions. Some scenarios prefer to unite all
  these functions into one primordial system, as illustrated in the lipid world
  scenario, which is considered as a didactic example in detail. Experimentally
  produced chemical replicators grow parabolically owing to product inhibition.
  A selection consequence is survival of everybody. The chromatographized
  replicator model predicts that such replicators spreading on surfaces can be
  selected for higher replication rate because double strands are washed away
  slower than single strands from the surface. Analysis of real ribozymes
  suggests that the error threshold of replication is less severe by about one
  order of magnitude than thought previously. Surface-bound dynamics is
  predicted to play a crucial role also for exponential replicators: unlinked
  genes belonging to the same genome do not displace each other by competition,
  and efficient and accurate replicases can spread. The most efficient form of
  such useful population structure is encapsulation by reproducing vesicles.
  The stochastic corrector model shows how such a bag of genes can survive, and
  what the role of chromosome formation and intragenic recombination could be.
  Prebiotic and early evolution cannot be understood without the models of
  dynamics.%

    Von Neumann's architecture for self-reproducing, evolvable machines is
  described. From this starting point, a number of issues relating to
  self-reproduction and evolution are discussed. A summary is given of various
  arguments which have been put forward regarding the superiority of genetic
  reproduction over self-inspection methods. It is argued that programs in
  artificial life platforms such as Tierra reproduce genetically rather than by
  self-inspection (as has previously been claimed). However, the distinction is
  blurred because significant parts of the reproduction process in Tierran
  programs are implicitly encoded in the Tierran operating system. The
  desirable features of a structure suitable for acting as a seed for an
  open-ended evolutionary process are discussed. It is found that the
  properties of such a structure are somewhat different to those of programs in
  Tierra-like platforms. These analyses suggest ways in which the evolvability
  of individuals in artificial life platforms may be improved, and also point
  to a number of open questions.%

    This work addresses the question: What are the basic design considerations
  for creating a synthetic model of the evolution of living systems (i.e. an
  `artificial life' system)? It can also be viewed as an attempt to elucidate
  the logical structure (in a very general sense) of biological evolution.
  However, with no adequate definition of life, the experimental portion of the
  work concentrates on more specific issues, and primarily on the issue of
  open-ended evolution. An artificial evolutionary system called Cosmos, which
  provides a virtual operating system capable of simulating the parallel
  processing and evolution of a population of several thousand self-reproducing
  computer programs, is introduced. Cosmos is related to Ray's established
  Tierra system [Ray 91], but there are a number of significant differences. A
  wide variety of experiments with Cosmos, which were designed to investigate
  its evolutionary dynamics, are reported. An analysis of the results is
  presented, with particular attention given to the role of contingency in
  determining the outcome of the runs. The results of this work, and
  consideration of the existing literature on artificial evolutionary systems,
  leads to the conclusion that artificial life models such as this are lacking
  on a number of theoretical and methodological grounds. It is emphasised that
  explicit theoretical considerations should guide the design of such models,
  if they are to be of scientific value. An analysis of various issues relating
  to self-reproduction, especially in the context of evolution, is presented,
  including some extensions to von Neumann's analysis of self-reproduction [von
  Neumann 66]. This suggests ways in which the evolutionary potential of such
  models might be improved. In particular, a shift of focus is recommended
  towards a more careful consideration of the phenotypic capabilities of the
  reproducing individuals. Phenotypic capabilities fundamentally involve
  interactions with the environment (both abiotic and biotic), and it is
  further argued that the theoretical grounding upon which these models should
  be based must include consideration of the kind of environments and the kind
  of interactions required for open-ended evolution. A number of useful future
  research directions are identified. Finally, the relevance of such work to
  the original goal of modelling the evolution of living systems (as opposed to
  the more general goal of modelling open-ended evolution) is discussed. It is
  suggested that the study of open-ended evolution can lead us to a better
  understanding of the essential properties of life, but only if the questions
  being asked in these studies are phrased appropriately.%

    The field of studies on complex systems is becoming one of the most active
  research areas in computer science. Among those systems, there is a type of
  system that has the following characteristics: comprising a large number of
  unintelligent elements, composition and decomposition of groups of elements,
  and simple but various interactions among the elements. In this paper, we
  present a formal model for describing the behavior of such type of complex
  system. The presented model is based on pattern matching, recombination of
  elements, and nondeterminism. We give example descriptions for several
  systems, which include a simple self-replicating creature, Turing machines,
  and a solver of the 3SAT problem.%

    Abstract Artificial chemistries are mainly used to construct virtual
  systems that are expected to show behavior similar to living systems. In this
  study, we explore possibilities of applying an artificial chemistry to
  modeling natural biochemical systems (or, to be specific, molecular computing
  systems) and show that it may be a useful modeling tool for molecular
  computation. We previously proposed an artificial chemistry based on string
  pattern matching and recombination. This article first demonstrates that this
  artificial chemistry is computationally universal if it has only rules that
  have one reactant or two reactants. We think this is a good property of an
  artificial chemistry that models molecular computing, because natural
  elementary chemical reactions, on which molecular computing is based, are
  mostly unimolecular or bimolecular. Then we give two illustrative example
  models for DNA computing in our artificial chemistry: one is for the type of
  computation called the Adleman-Lipton paradigm, and the other is for a DNA
  implementation of a finite automaton. Through the construction of these
  models we observe preferred properties of the artificial chemistry for
  modeling molecular computing, such as having no spatial structure and being
  flexible in choosing levels of abstraction.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    A model for intrinsic artificial development is introduced in this paper.
  The proposed model features a novel mechanism where growth emerges, rather
  than being triggered by a single action. Different types of cell signalling
  ensure that breaking symmetries is rather the norm than an exception, and
  gene activity is regulated on two layers: first, by the proteins that are
  produced by the gene regulatory network (GRN). Second, through structural
  feedback by second messenger molecules, which are not directly produced
  through gene expression, but are produced by sensor proteins, which take the
  cell's structure into account. The latter feedback mechanism is a novel
  approach, intended to enable adaptivity and environment coupling in
  real-world applications. The model is implemented in hardware, and is
  designed to run autonomously in resource limited embedded systems. Initial
  experiments are carried out to measure long-term stability, dynamics,
  adaptivity and scalability of the new approach. Furthermore the ability of
  the GRN to produce patterns of different symmetries is examined.%

    We developed a simulation tool for investigating the evolution of early
  metabolism, allowing us to speculate on the formation of metabolic pathways
  from catalyzed chemical reactions and development of characteristic
  properties. Our model consists of a protocellular entity with a simple
  RNA-based genetic system and an evolving metabolism of catalytically active
  ribozymes that manipulate a rich underlying chemistry. Ensuring an almost
  open-ended and fairly realistic simulation is crucial for understanding the
  first steps in metabolic evolution. We show here how our simulation tool can
  be helpful in arguing for or against hypotheses on the evolution of metabolic
  pathways. We demonstrate that seemingly mutually exclusive hypotheses may
  well be compatible when we take into account that different processes
  dominate different phases in the evolution of a metabolic system. Our results
  suggest that forward evolution shapes metabolic network in the very early
  steps of evolution. In later and more complex stages, enzyme recruitment
  supersedes forward evolution, keeping a core set of pathways from the early
  phase.%

    Abstract All life, as we know it, springs from already existing life. But
  how did it all begin? We argue that evolution preceded life, and we must
  understand the origin of evolvable chemical systems as their gradual increase
  of complexity lead to the appearance of the first living entity. In this
  chapter, we discuss various theoretical models that have been proposed to
  explain the origin of evolvable systems (including template replicators,
  autocatalytic cycles, polymer autocatalytic sets, and the \{GARD\} model) and
  translate the critical properties of evolution to features of chemical
  networks.%

    BACKGROUND:Our current understanding of evolution is so tightly linked to
  template-dependent replication of DNA and RNA molecules that the old idea
  from Oparin of a self-reproducing 'garbage bag' ('coacervate') of chemicals
  that predated fully-fledged cell-like entities seems to be farfetched to most
  scientists today. However, this is exactly the kind of scheme we propose for
  how Darwinian evolution could have occurred prior to template
  replication.RESULTS:We cannot confirm previous claims that autocatalytic sets
  of organic polymer molecules could undergo evolution in any interesting sense
  by themselves. While we and others have previously imagined inhibition would
  result in selectability, we found that it produced multiple attractors in an
  autocatalytic set that cannot be selected for. Instead, we discovered that if
  general conditions are satisfied, the accumulation of adaptations in chemical
  reaction networks can occur. These conditions are the existence of rare
  reactions producing viable cores (analogous to a genotype), that sustains a
  molecular periphery (analogous to a phenotype).CONCLUSIONS:We conclude that
  only when a chemical reaction network consists of many such viable cores, can
  it be evolvable. When many cores are enclosed in a compartment there is
  competition between cores within the same compartment, and when there are
  many compartments, there is between-compartment competition due to the
  phenotypic effects of cores and their periphery at the compartment level.
  Acquisition of cores by rare chemical events, and loss of cores at division,
  allows macromutation, limited heredity and selectability, thus explaining how
  a poor man's natural selection could have operated prior to genetic
  templates. This is the only demonstration to date of a mechanism by which
  pre-template accumulation of adaptation could occur.REVIEWERS:This article
  was reviewed by William Martin and Eugene Koonin.%

    Abstract While it is generally agreed that some kind of replicating
  non-living compounds were the precursors of life, there is much debate over
  their possible chemical nature. Metabolism-first approaches propose that
  mutually catalytic sets of simple organic molecules could be capable of
  self-replication and rudimentary chemical evolution. In particular, the
  graded autocatalysis replication domain (GARD) model, depicting assemblies of
  amphiphilic molecules, has received considerable interest. The system
  propagates compositional information across generations and is suggested to
  be a target of natural selection. However, evolutionary simulations indicate
  that the system lacks selectability (i.e. selection has negligible effect on
  the equilibrium concentrations). We elaborate on the lessons learnt from the
  example of the \{GARD\} model and, more widely, on the issue of evolvability,
  and discuss the implications for similar metabolism-first scenarios. We found
  that simple incorporation-type chemistry based on non-covalent bonds, as
  assumed in GARD, is unlikely to result in alternative autocatalytic cycles
  when catalytic interactions are randomly distributed. An even more serious
  problem stems from the lognormal distribution of catalytic factors, causing
  inherent kinetic instability of such loops, due to the dominance of
  efficiently catalyzed components that fail to return catalytic aid.
  Accordingly, the dynamics of the \{GARD\} model is dominated by strongly
  catalytic, but not auto-catalytic, molecules. Without effective
  autocatalysis, stable hereditary propagation is not possible. Many
  repetitions and different scaling of the model come to no rescue. Despite all
  attempts to show the contrary, the \{GARD\} model is not evolvable, in
  contrast to reflexively autocatalytic networks, complemented by rare
  uncatalyzed reactions and compartmentation. The latter networks, resting on
  the creation and breakage of chemical bonds, can generate novel ('mutant')
  autocatalytic loops from a given set of environmentally available compounds.
  Real chemical reactions that make or break covalent bonds, rather than mere
  incorporation of components, are necessary for open-ended evolvability. The
  issue of whether or not several concrete chemical systems (rather than
  singular curiosities) could realize reflexively autocatalytic macromolecular
  networks will ultimately determine the relevance of metabolism-first
  approaches to the origin of life, as stepping stones towards true
  open-endedness that requires the combination of rich combinatorial chemistry
  controlled by information stored in template replicators.%

  simpler, so remaining sections assume this. SGA G = M and F. F is focussed,

    The aim of this paper is to contribute to complex systems thinking in
  manufacturing organisations through the development of a metric for
  operational complexity. Operational complexity is concerned with the temporal
  aspects of coordination and control in manufacturing systems. Statistical
  complexity from computational mechanics theory is proposed as the metric. The
  metric can potentially be used to support decision making by objective
  assessment of complexity. The properties of the metric are explored through
  simulation studies. The simulation results confirm that the proposed metric
  captures the intuitive notion of complexity. It is shown that operational
  complexity is influenced by internal factors such as system structure, as
  well as external ones such as demand, and that complexity can be managed
  through the application of appropriate control methods. A case study is
  presented that applies the metric to real production data. The case study
  shows that the global recession had resulted in a decreased operational
  complexity of outputs.%

  switched between tracks (as it were) by a more regular genetic mechanism. As

    Top-down causation has been suggested to occur at all scales of biological
  organization as a mechanism for explaining the hierarchy of structure and
  causation in living systems (Campbell, 1974; Auletta et al., 2008; Davies,
  2006b, 2012; Ellis, 2012). Here we propose that a transition from bottom-up
  to top-down causation - mediated by a reversal in the flow of information
  from lower to higher levels of organization, to that from higher to lower
  levels of organization - is a driving force for most major evolutionary
  transitions. We suggest that many major evolutionary transitions might
  therefore be marked by a transition in causal structure. We use logistic
  growth as a toy model for demonstrating how such a transition can drive the
  emergence of collective behavior in replicative systems. We then outline how
  this scenario may have played out in those major evolutionary transitions in
  which new, higher levels of organization emerged, and propose possible
  methods via which our hypothesis might be tested.%

    How can a system become better adapted over time without natural selection?
  Although some argue for 'organismic' properties such as robustness and
  self-sustaining regulation in non-evolved systems [1,5,11], others insist
  that natural selection is the only source of true adaptation [3]. We suggest
  that understanding how adaptation can occur without natural selection remains
  a fundamental open question for the Artificial Life community. For example,
  the origin of life, the origin of evolution, and the origin of new units of
  selection in the major evolutionary transitions/biological dynamical
  hierarchies, all seem to imply an adaptive process, or at least a
  non-arbitrary organisational process, that precedes the onset of natural
  selection proper (at each level of organisation). In recent work we have been
  developing a number of inter-related concepts that approach this question
  from different angles [2,6,7,8,9,10,12,13,14,15]. In a general sense, it is
  known that a complex dynamical system can self-organise in a manner that
  reflects structure in external perturbations. But more specifically, we find
  that when variables in the system have a bi-modal distribution of decay
  constants (some fast and many slow), slow variables spontaneously act in a
  manner functionally equivalent to the weights of a neural network undergoing
  Hebbian learning, thereby modulating the behaviour of the fast variables such
  that the resultant internalised structure takes the form of an associative
  memory [4]. The proximal cause of these changes is merely that such a
  configuration is less resistant to, and hence less affected by, the
  perturbations to the system (c.f. homeostasis). But the system-scale
  consequences of this structuring is that such a system can 'recall',
  'recognise' or 'classify' stimuli and, given appropriate structure in the
  perturbations, generalise to previously unseen stimuli, in just the same
  manner as a trained neural network [4]. This provides a framework to connect
  the concepts of a dynamical system merely 'doing what it does naturally' at
  one scale of explanation with interpretation as an adaptive system at
  another. In particular, in the joint phase space of both fast and slow
  variables the system merely decreases in energy, as one would expect from any
  purely mechanistic explanation. But induced structure in the slow variables
  improves the ability to dissipate energy from the fast state variables. Thus
  with respect to the fast system variables only, systems organised in this
  manner do not merely minimise system energy but get better at minimising
  energy over time. When the external environment of the system corresponds to
  an optimisation problem, the system thus improves its ability to solve that
  problem over time. It is in this sense that we can understand the system, not
  just as self-organised, but adapted. We present an abstract model and
  simulation of this process and discuss how it relates to a number of
  different domains: the evolution of evolvability in gene regulation networks
  [12], the evolution of new units of selection [10] via symbiosis [15] and
  'social niche construction''[8,9], games on adaptive networks [2],
  distributed optimisation in multi-agent complex adaptive systems [13,14] and
  multi-scale optimisation algorithms [6,7].%

    \field{abstract}{%
    The overlapping fields of adaptive behavior and artificial life are often
  described as novel approaches to biology. They focus attention on bottom-up
  explanations and how lifelike phenomena can result from relatively simple
  systems interacting dynamically with their environments. They are also
  characterized by the use of synthetic methodologies, that is, building
  artificial systems as a means of exploring these ideas. Two differing
  approaches can be distinguished: building models of specific animal systems
  and assessing them within complete behavior-environment loops; and exploring
  the behavior of invented artificial animals, often called animats, under
  similar conditions. An obvious question about the latter approach is, how can
  we learn about real biology from simulation of non-existent animals? In this
  article I will argue, first, that animat research, to the extent that it is
  relevant to biology, should also be considered as model building. Animat
  simulations do, implicitly, represent hypotheses about, and should be
  evaluated by comparison to, animals. Casting this research in terms of
  invented agents serves only to limit the ability to draw useful conclusions
  from it by deflecting or deferring any serious comparisons of the model
  mechanisms and results with real biological systems. Claims that animat
  models are meant to be existence proofs, idealizations, or represent general
  problems in biology do not make these models qualitatively different from
  more conventional models of specific animals, nor undermine the ultimate
  requirement to justify this work by making concrete comparisons with
  empirical data. It is thus suggested that we will learn more by choosing
  real, and not made-up, targets for our models.%

    Robustness, the insensitivity of some of a biological system's
  functionalities to a set of distinct conditions, is intimately linked to
  fitness. Recent studies suggest that it may also play a vital role in
  enabling the evolution of species. Increasing robustness, so is proposed, can
  lead to the emergence of evolvability if evolution proceeds over a neutral
  network that extends far throughout the fitness landscape. Here, we show that
  the design principles used to achieve robustness dramatically influence
  whether robustness leads to evolvability. In simulation experiments, we find
  that purely redundant systems have remarkably low evolvability while
  degenerate, i.e. partially redundant, systems tend to be orders of magnitude
  more evolvable. Surprisingly, the magnitude of observed variation in
  evolvability can neither be explained by differences in the size north
  etopology of the neutral networks. This suggests that degeneracy, a
  ubiquitous characteristic in biological systems, may be an important enabler
  of natural evolution. More generally, our study provides valuable new clues a
  bout the origin of innovations in complex adaptive systems. (C) 2009 Elsevier

    Epsilon machine is a computational mechanics theory and its most effective
  reconstruction algorithm is causal state splitting reconstruction (CSSR). As
  CSSR can only be applied to symbol series, symbolising real series to symbol
  series is necessary in practice. Epsilon machine discovers the hidden pattern
  of a system. In reconstructed results, the hidden pattern is expressed as the
  set of causal states. Based on the variation of causal states, a novel
  anomaly detection algorithm, structure vector model, is presented. The vector
  is composed of the causal states, and the anomaly measure is defined with the
  distance of different vectors. An example of the crankshaft fatigue
  demonstrates the effectiveness of the model. The mechanism of the model is
  discussed in detail from three aspects, computational mechanics, symbolic
  dynamics and complex networks. The new idea defining anomaly measure based on
  the variation of hidden patterns can be interpreted reasonably with the
  hierarchical structure of complex networks. The jump in anomaly curves is a
  nature candidate for the threshold, which confirms the positive meaning of
  the model. Finally, the parameter choice and time complexity are briefly
  analysed.%

    Regulatory molecular networks have numerous pharmacological and medical
  applications. The oscillatory mechanisms and the role of oscillations in
  these regulatory networks are not fully understood. In this paper, we explore
  two oscillatory mechanisms: the hysteresis-based relaxation oscillator and
  the repressilator. We combine these mechanisms into one regulatory network so
  that only two parameters, the strength of an additional regulatory connection
  and the timescale separation for one of the variables, control the transition
  from one mechanism to the other. Our data support a qualitative difference
  between the oscillatory mechanisms, but in the parameter space, we found a
  single oscillatory region, suggesting that the two mechanisms support each
  other. We examine interactions in a basic population: that is, a pair of the
  composite oscillators. We found that the relaxation oscillation mechanism is
  much more resistant to oscillatory death as the cells are diffusively coupled
  in a population. Additionally, stationary pattern formation has been found to
  accompany the relaxation oscillation but not the repressilator mechanism.
  These properties may guide the identification of oscillatory mechanisms in
  complex natural regulatory networks.%

    Evolutionary design synthesis has been used in solving many engineering
  design problems due to the reliability, robustness and domain-independence of
  evolutionary algorithms. However, little has been done to explore the role of
  design knowledge in evolutionary design synthesis. In this paper, inspired by
  recent advances in evolutionary developmental biology (Evo-Devo), we propose
  an Evo-Devo framework for computational design synthesis that utilizes design
  knowledge to guide an evolutionary search processes. The framework embodies a
  new regulation process to derive feasible phenotypes from the synthesis of
  genotypes and design knowledge. A multi-agent system (MAS) is implemented to
  perform the regulation needed to enforce the constraint satisfaction of
  phenotypes. The practical applicability of the Evo-Devo framework is
  validated through a meal design problem to be solved as a case study. The
  results indicate that the Evo-Devo framework and its regulation process
  outperform traditional processes in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and
  reliability in searching a constrained design space. The proposed framework
  and the MAS-based implementation of the regulation process can be applied to
  improve the performance of evolutionary design synthesis in different domains
  and tasks in general.%

    A little-noted result of the confirmation of multiple premises of the
  RNA-world hypothesis is that we now know something about the dawn organisms
  that followed the origin of life, perhaps over 4 billion years ago. We are
  therefore in an improved position to reason about the biota just before RNA
  times, during the era of the first replicators, the first Darwinian creatures
  on Earth. An RNA congener still prominent in modern biology is a plausible
  descendent of these first replicators.%

    High-dimensional, multispectral data on complex physical systems are
  increasingly common. As the amount of information in data sets increases, the
  difficulty of effectively utilizing it also increases. For such data, summary
  information is required for understanding and modeling the underlying
  dynamics. It is here proposed to use an extension of computational mechanics
  {[}C. R. Shalizi and J. P. Crutchfield, J. Stat. Phys. 104, 817 (2001)] to
  arbitrary spatiotemporal and spectral dimension, for providing such summary
  information. An example of the use of these tools to identify state evolution
  in the brain, an archetypal, complex biophysical system, serves as an
  illustration.%

    An information theory based formalism for medical image analysis proposed
  in Young et al. {[}Young, K., Chen, Y., Kornak, J., Matson G. B., Schuff, N.,
  2005. Summarizing Complexity in High Dimensions, Phys. Rev. Lett. 94
  098701-1] is described and used to estimate image complexity measures as a
  means of generating interpretable summary information. An analysis of
  anatomical brain MRI data exhibiting cortical thinning, currently considered
  to be a sensitive early biomarker for neurodegenerative diseases, is used to
  illustrate the method. Though requiring no previous assumptions about the
  detailed shape of the cortex or other brain structures, the method performed
  comparably (sensitivity= 0.91) to direct cortical thickness estimation
  techniques (sensitivity= 0.93) at separating populations in a data set
  designed specifically to test the cortical thickness estimation algorithms.
  The results illustrate that the complexity estimation method, though general,
  is capable of providing interpretable diagnostic information. (C) 2007

    We introduce a simple Artificial Chemistry to provide an open-ended
  representation for the exploration of artificial evolution. The chemistry
  includes an energy model based on the conservation of total kinetic and
  potential energy, and a constructive reaction model where possible reactions
  are discovered ?on-the-fly?. The implementation is built on an existing
  open-source cheminformatics toolkit for performance and has a feature-set

    BACKGROUND:Replicators are the crucial entities in evolution. The notion of
  a replicator, however, is far less exact than the weight of its importance.
  Without identifying and classifying multiplying entities exactly, their
  dynamics cannot be determined appropriately. Therefore, it is importance to
  decide the nature and characteristics of any multiplying entity, in a
  detailed and formal way.RESULTS:Replication is basically an autocatalytic
  process which enables us to rest on the notions of formal chemistry. This
  statement has major implications. Simple autocatalytic cycle intermediates
  are considered as non-informational replicators. A consequence of which is
  that any autocatalytically multiplying entity is a replicator, be it simple
  or overly complex (even nests). A stricter definition refers to entities
  which can inherit acquired changes (informational replicators). Simple
  autocatalytic molecules (and nests) are excluded from this group. However, in
  turn, any entity possessing copiable information is to be named a replicator,
  even multicellular organisms. In order to deal with the situation, an
  abstract, formal framework is presented, which allows the proper
  identification of various types of replicators. This sheds light on the old
  problem of the units and levels of selection and evolution. A hierarchical
  classification for the partition of the replicator-continuum is provided
  where specific replicators are nested within more general ones. The
  classification should be able to be successfully applied to known replicators
  and also to future candidates.CONCLUSION:This paper redefines the concept of
  the replicator from a bottom-up theoretical approach. The formal definition
  and the abstract models presented can distinguish between among all possible
  replicator types, based on their quantity of variable and heritable
  information. This allows for the exact identification of various replicator
  types and their underlying dynamics. The most important claim is that
  replication, in general, is basically autocatalysis, with a specific defined
  environment and selective force. A replicator is not valid unless its working
  environment, and the selective force to which it is subject, is specified.%
