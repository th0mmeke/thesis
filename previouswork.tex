\chapter{Previous work}

The previous sections have established the context, and identified the primary areas of relevant literature. From biology, the main threads concern the origins of life, and the theory of evolution. Natural selection provides the primary mechanism for evolution in biology, although it is not the only process at work -- genetic drift and neutral theory provide a counterpoint. In artificial systems, researchers have used biological evolution as an inspiration, gradually over time diverging into a field with the beginnings of its own motivating theory, now only loosely connected with its origins in the natural world.

The research emphasis in artificial systems has more recently returned to a reappreciation of how biological evolution generates robust, novel, creative outcomes, unlike those seen in current artificial evolution. This has led to a renewed interest in understanding the principles behind biological evolution so that artificial systems can capture some of those admirable properties; the difference now is that the transference is sought at the level of concepts and principles rather than in the historical inspiration of specific biological elements and structures, many of which are contingent and perhaps even arbitrary; certainly complex.

This section now expands upon previous work that is directly relevant to our specific problem, the onset of evolution in artificial systems, in four areas:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Principles behind biological evolution
	\item Generalisations from biological and artificial evolution
	\item General evolutionary models
	\item Specific work in artificial systems
\end{itemize}

\section{Principles behind biological evolution}

\autocite{Watson2012}:

\begin{itemize}
	\item
	
	``We take it as given that biology instantiates ENS'' - but that
	doesn't mean that the algorithm of biology is ENS. Biological
	evolution may be superset of ENS, and ENS may not be sufficient for
	biological evolution. Hampered by circular reasoning that ENS
	described in terms of biological evolution
	
	\item
	
	{[}fundamentally addresses issues of algorithmic equivalence between
	biological evolution and ENS, without concerning the problem of ENS
	and evolution in general{]}
	
\end{itemize}

		evolutionary
		transitions''}\label{watson2015---evolutionary-connectionism-algorithmic-principles-underlying-the-evolution-of-biological-organisation-in-dvo-devo-evo-eco-and-evolutionary-transitions}}

\begin{itemize}
	\item
	
	Darwinian machine is fundamentally self-referential - products of
	evolution affect process of evolution - lots of examples
	
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item
		
		Major transitions in evolution not possible without
		self-referentiality - unit of evolution must change between levels
		e.g., from molecules to cells. This was/is accomplished by changing
		the way that individuals interact, from competition to cooperation
		(fitness change) to form the next level. How does selection at one
		level get suppressed, and introduced at the next?
		
		\item
		
		Maynard-Smith/Szathmary
		
		\item
		
		Independent replication before transition, must replicate as part of
		a larger whole afterwards
		
		\item
		
		Fundamental for complexity - complexity associated with levels
		
		\item
		
		Draws analogy with Hinton 2008 Deep Learning
		
		\item
		
		At one level, supervised learning improving adaptation; at next
		higher, unsupervised improving robustness
		
		\item
		
		Modes of inheritance (for groups)
		
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item
			
			``migrant pools'' - particles disperse horizontally and reform
			into new pools - type 1 group selection - no group inheritance
			
			\item
			
			Group fissioning - vertical inheritance - group inheritance
			(differences are heritable) - type 2
			
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}




\section{Generalisations from biological and artificial evolution}
\hypertarget{griesemer2005---the-informational-gene-and-the-substantial-body-on-the-generalization-of-evolutionary-theory-by-abstraction}{\subsection{Griesemer2005
		- ``The Informational Gene and the Substantial Body: On the
		Generalization of Evolutionary Theory by
		Abstraction''}\label{griesemer2005---the-informational-gene-and-the-substantial-body-on-the-generalization-of-evolutionary-theory-by-abstraction}}

\begin{itemize}
	\item
	
	``Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection is restricted in
	scope. One sense in which it is restricted is that it refers to
	organisms.''
	
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item
		
		``a theory of descent with modification''
		
		\item
		
		natural selection as important mechanism of modification
		
		\item
		
		``Owing to this struggle for life, any variation, however slight and
		from whatever cause proceeding, if it be in any degree profitable to
		an individual of any species, in its infinitely complex relations to
		other organic beings and to external nature, will tend to the
		preservation of that individual, and will generally be inherited by
		its offspring. The offspring, also, will thus have a better chance
		of surviving, for, of the many individuals of any species which are
		periodically born, but a small number can survive. I have called
		this principle, by which each slight variation, if useful, is
		preserved, by the term of Natural Selection, in order to mark its
		relation to man's power of selection (Darwin 1859, p. 61).''
		
		\item
		
		Restricted by:
		
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item
			
			natural selection, not drift or Lamarckian (biased) inheritance
			
			\item
			
			organisms not defined - so scope vague. Many treat vertebrates as
			paradigm, despite rarity
			
			\item
			
			organismal level - but many other levels
			
		\end{itemize}
		\item
		
		``Darwin's theory is about a complex causal process, not merely a
		description of effects or patterns''
		
	\end{itemize}
	\item
	
	Weismannism - central dogma! Causal relationships between genes and
	soma (body)
	
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item
		
		EB Wilson (1896) version (restricted version of Weismann) - genes
		inherited, soma transitory, genes causally responsible for soma, but
		no causal relationship back from soma to gene
		
		\item
		
		Crick's central dogma - molecular interpretation DNA/RNA/protein -
		isomorphic to Wilson
		
		\item
		
		Maynard Smith compared Wilson and Crick explicitly showing
		isomorphism
		
		\item
		
		Weismann own view showed gene-plasma (``molecular protoplasm of the
		nucleus'') also continuous despite gene-cells not being so. Heredity
		is a function of development - somatic differentiation causes
		continuity of germ-plasm and so soma affects soma - causal link
		added to Wilson (Weismannism) from soma to soma
		
	\end{itemize}
	\item
	
	Strategies for abstraction
	
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item
		
		``An important ``Platonic'' conception is that abstraction is a
		mental process by which properties are thought of as entities
		distinct from the concrete objects in which they are instantiated.
		On an alternative, Aristotelian conception, abstraction is the
		mental process of subtracting certain accidental properties from
		concrete objects so as to regard objects in a manner closer to their
		essential natures.''
		
		\item
		
		Cartwright and Mendell use Aristotle's four kinds of cause as
		ordering criteria for relative abstractness - material, efficient,
		formal, final
		
		\item
		
		``Levels abstraction''
		
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item
			
			Lewontin argued that can abstract form of individual to more
			general entity (at any level) - ``any entities in nature that have
			variation, reproduction and heritability may evolve'' Lewontin1970
			as necessary and sufficient conditions (despite ``may''?)
			
			\item
			
			assumes an a priori ``biological hierarchy'', and evolution
			operates on any level of that hierarchy given certain properties
			for units at that level
			
			\item
			
			Problem is that no criteria for recognizing elements (variation,
			reproduction, and heritability) at any level other than
			organismal. Complicated further by clonal, asexual etc...How to
			recognize individual - e.g., ``individuation criteria''
			
		\end{itemize}
		\item
		
		``the second strategy abstracts from kinds of explanatory properties
		of significant entities at the canonical hierarchical levels of
		neo-Darwinian explanation'' - functional roles
		
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item
			
			Replicators (e.g., genes) and vehicles (e.g., organisms)
			
			\item
			
			abstracts roles of organisms and genes to two level hierarchy of
			``interactors'' and ``replicators'' (Hull)
			
			\item
			
			``The problem is how to square the information analysis at the
			molecular level with the belief that evolution may occur at a
			variety of levels: the more seriously one takes information, the
			more likely one is to deny that evolution happens at any level
			other than that of the gene.'' Leads to idea that genes are
			information, and that must be ``genes'' at each level of
			hierarchy.
			
			\item
			
			Key problem is that other information other than gene equivalent
			(e.g., development) may be needed at different levels (when don't
			have genes or equivalents) and yet
			
			\item
			
			In an Estimation Distribution Algorithm (EDA), the algorithm tries
			to determine the distribution of the solution features, e.g.
			probability of having a 1-bit at a particular position, at the
			optimum. Some EDAs can be regarded abstractions of evolutionary
			processes: instead of generating new solutions through variation
			and then selecting from these, EDAs use a more direct approach to
			refine the underlying probability distribution. The perspective of
			updating a probability distribution is similar to the
			Wright--Fisher model.
			
			\item
			
			doesn't allow soma-soma (although Weismann does, but in practice
			developmental mechanisms preclude it - single zygote stage makes
			it hard for soma changes to be inherited)
			
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
	\item
	
	``One must clearly distinguish between heredity (a relation),
	heritability (a capacity), and inheritance (a process)''
	
\end{itemize}

\autocite{Paixao2015}:

\begin{itemize}
	\item
	
	attempt to unify evolutionary computation and population genetics -
	based on common conception of evolutionary process
	
	\item
	
	Related work in Population Genetics
	
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item
		
		PG evolution described by dynamics of allele or genotype frequencies
		
		\item
		
		Lewontin 1964 equation for canonical evolutionary process - genotype
		frequencies, based on common ``genetic operator'' for rate of
		generating a genotype x from parents y and z (combines mutation,
		recombination etc)
		
		\item
		
		This and other models biologically focussed - where ``selection
		assumes a particular form''
		
		\item
		
		Another approach to PG quantitative genetics - phenotypic view of
		trait evolution. Useful in animal breeding. Doesn't address
		mechanism (genetics)
		
		\item
		
		Price equation - very general, useful for that reason in comparing
		models
		
	\end{itemize}
	\item
	
	Any evolutionary process describes ``population undergoing changes
	over time based on some set of transformations''
	
	\item
	
	A transformation can be decomposed into a collection of (stochastic)
	operators. Operator can be described as a probability distribution of
	potential outcomes; and evolutionary process as a trajectory through a
	space of distributions.
	
	\item
	
	Process described both as a sequence of population transformations,
	and as distribution transformations
	
	\item
	
	Individuals described with both genotype and phenotype; gp mapping
	between them. Some operators act on genotype others on phenotype
	
	\item
	
	Various operators defined - for selection (uniform, proportional,
	tournament, truncation, cut, replace); variation (mutation) (uniform,
	single-point), variation (recombination) (one-point crossover, k-point
	crossover, uniform crossover, unbiased variation)
	
	\item
	
	Most models satisfy five given mathematical properties
	
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item
		
		V1 - uniformity preserving - no change to distribution if uniformly
		distributed
		
		\item
		
		M1 - mutation acts on individuals
		
		\item
		
		M2 - mutation can generate whole search space ie an ergodic operator
		(defining characteristic of mutations)
		
		\item
		
		R1 - recombination preserves allele frequencies (in expectation)
		
		\item
		
		S1 - selection doesn't change individuals
		
	\end{itemize}
	\item
	
	Demonstrates how existing ``classical models in theoretical population
	genetics and in the theory of evolutionary computation'' can be mapped
	into this framework. Most of PG models can be represented
	(unsurprising as most variants of classical models that have been
	demonstrated in framework); some topic-specific EC models could not be
	- but not ones that have a relationship with PG and so of little
	interest to biologists. GP models omitted for reasons of balance
	between simplicity and inclusiveness
	
	\item
	
	Leaves MOEAs for later work
	
	\item
	
	``In an Estimation Distribution Algorithm (EDA), the algorithm tries
	to determine the distribution of the solution features, e.g.
	probability of having a 1-bit at a particular position, at the
	optimum. Some EDAs can be regarded abstractions of evolutionary
	processes: instead of generating new solutions through variation and
	then selecting from these, EDAs use a more direct approach to refine
	the underlying probability distribution. The perspective of updating a
	probability distribution is similar to the Wright--Fisher model.''
	
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item
		
		Close similarity between simplest EDA (the Univariate Marginal
		Distribution Algorithm) and Linkage equilibrium models in population
		genetics as pointed out in Chastain2014 (``We demonstrate that in
		the regime of weak selection, the standard equations of population
		genetics describing natural selection in the presence of sex become
		identical to those of a repeated game between genes played according
		to multiplicative weight updates (MWUA), an algorithm known in
		computer science to be surprisingly powerful and versatile. MWUA
		maximizes a tradeoff between cumulative performance and entropy,
		which suggests a new view on the maintenance of diversity in
		evolution.'')
		
		\item
		
		AdaBoost is a form of MWUA
		(\href{https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~arora/pubs/MWsurvey.pdf}{\emph{https://www.cs.princeton.edu/\textasciitilde{}arora/pubs/MWsurvey.pdf}})
		
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\autocite{Barton2014}

\begin{itemize}
	\item
	
	Experts in MWUA equivalent to alleles in NS
	
	\item
	
	In selection, ``frequency of each type {[}allele{]} is simply
	multiplied by its relative fitness; which corresponds precisely to
	MWUA''
	
	\item
	
	MWUA ``maximizes the sum of two quantities: the expected total fitness
	of the chosen allele, summed over past generations, plus the entropy,
	which is a measure of the allelic diversity.''
	
	\item
	
	Fitness differences increase over time, and so population converges
	towards type with best performance; entropy term acts to slow down
	this convergence
	
	\item
	
	Problems
	
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item
		
		because MWUA is deterministic, and some interesting problems e.g.,
		recombination as a mechanism for reintroducing gene combinations
		lost through drift in finite populations, are essentially
		stochastic, MWUA cannot address them
		
		\item
		
		Value of sex - MWUA applies equally to sexual and asexual
		populations so hard to gain insights as to role of sex
		
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\autocite{Chastain2014}:

\begin{itemize}
	\item
	
	Assumes weak selection - from paper: differences in fitness between
	genotypes are small relative to the recombination rate and so
	evolution proceeds near linkage equilibrium - probability of
	occurrence of a certain genotype is the product of the probabilities
	of each of its alleles
	
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item
		
		{[}Weak selection where two phenotypes have similar fitness, and so
		one only slightly preferred. Only relevant (claim elsewhere -
		wikipedia) that only relevant in Moran process (fixed population as
		births-deaths paired - no birth without a death) as in growing
		population both can proliferate and weak selection results in
		effectively no selection{]}
		
		\item
		
		{[}Also assumes sexual reproduction - ``in the presence of sexual
		reproduction'', and does not address mutation{]}
		
	\end{itemize}
	\item
	
	Shows that ``equations of population genetic dynamics are
	mathematically equivalent to positing that each locus selects a
	probability distribution on alleles according to a particular
	rule...known as the multiplicative weight updates algorithm (MWUA)''
	
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item
		
		Uses Nagylaki's theorem for allele frequencies given weak selection
		in presence of sex
		
		\item
		
		NS is ``tantamount to each locus choosing at each generation its
		allele frequencies in the population so as to maximize the sum of
		the expected cumulative differential fitness over the alleles, plus
		the distribution's entropy.''
		
	\end{itemize}
	\item
	
	Hints that MWUA enhances entropy of alleles' distribution, so helping
	to maintain genetic diversity under NS - a ``tradeoff between
	increasing entropy and increasing (cumulative) fitness.''

\end{itemize}


\autocite{Saunders1994}

\begin{itemize}
	\item
	
	Lack of proof that NS was mechanism of natural evolution {[}still
	discussion e.g., Masatoshi Nei stressing mutation as driver;
	acceptance e.g, Mayr, that Darwin couldn't prove NS as mechanism for

	\item
	
	Lovelock proposed Daisyworld as alternative explanation (rather than
	selection) for regulation as seen in Gaia hypothesis, and in organisms
	
	\item
	
	Two feedback loops lead to regulation, ``As a result, regulation, one
	of the most fundamental and necessary properties of organisms, appears
	without being selected for. What is more, it appears as a property not
	of the daisies, on which natural selection may have acted, but of the
	planet, on which, as Dawkins rightly points out, it could not.''

	{[}individuals modify environment{]}
	
	\item
	
	Daisies adapt planet (temperature for maximum growth) to suit
	themselves, rather than themselves to planet
	
	\item
	
	Little benefit to adaptation by daisies to planet. In fact, ``the
	ability to withstand a greater variability is not the result of
	Darwinian adaptation. On the contrary, it exists because of the
	absence of Darwinian adaptation.''
	
	\item
	
	``What is especially interesting for biology is that the problems
	arise when we try to optimize simultaneously two connected features of
	a structure. They will therefore not be revealed by a research
	strategy which seeks to account for organisms by decomposing them into
	individual traits which, so it is assumed, are acted on separately by
	natural selection.'' -- an argument for a holistic rather than reductionist view.
	
\end{itemize}

\section{Specific work in artificial systems}

Minimal conditions for evolutionary system capable of open-ended (but not necessarily interesting behaviour)

\begin{itemize}
	\item
	      Elements that allow for ongoing evolution--necessary, and starting
	      point for novelty
	\item
	      Open-ended evolution can be seen as evolution in an open-ended system
	      (\eg Chemistry), where an open-ended system has effectively
	      unrestricted representation: the number of possible types must be much
	      larger than the number of individuals (ideally without any
	      restriction). Without this property all possible types can be
	      generated in a finite time, and the system will either reach stasis or
	      begin to repeat. Not all open-ended systems necessarily support
	      evolution, but in those that do, our intuition suggests that
	      open-ended evolution produces increasing complexity, increasing
	      diversity, accumulation of novelty and continual adaptation
	      \autocite{Lehman2012}.
\end{itemize}

\quote{
	by open-ended evolutionary capacity we understand the potential of a
	system to reproduce its basic functional-constitutive dynamics, bringing
	about an un-limited variety of equivalent systems, of ways of expressing
	that dynamics, which are not subject to any predetermined upper bound of
	organizational complexity (even if they are, indeed, to the
	energetic-material restrictions imposed by a finite environment and by
the universal physico-chemical laws.}
{\autocite{Ruiz-Mirazo2004}}

\begin{itemize}
	\item
	      Open-ended from \autocite{MaynardSmith1999} definition--\TODO{ size of search space vs population}
	\item
	      Heritability a challenge--biological organisms employ digital
	      heredity; sophisticated mechanism with controlled error rates, but
	      exceedingly unlikely to arise spontaneously
	\item
	      Multiplication/heredity for maintenance of population
	\item
	      Analog methods possible--\eg:
	      	
	      \begin{itemize}
	      	\item
	      	      compositional (where new entity contains some elements of original)
	      	      (as seen in ACS ``core'' inheritance e.g., \autocite{Vasas2015, Watson2012}?)
	      	\item
	      	      \quote{migrant pools}{\autocite{Watson2015}}
	      	\item
	      	      Group fissioning \autocite{Watson2015}
	      	\item
	      	      Attractor based \autocite{Szathmary2000}
	      \end{itemize}
	\item
	      Heredity seen as method to maintain low entropy over much longer time
	      than possible with non-''biological'' systems \autocite{Adami2015}
	\item
	      Argument that heredity may in fact be a product of evolution rather than a precursor \autocite{Bourrat2015}
	\item
	      \autocite{Kauffman:1993kk} argued that self-organization (RAPN) can replace the genome
\end{itemize}

\autocite{Bourrat2015} showed that inheritance bias (correlation in trait between parent and offspring) increases over time

\begin{itemize}
	\item
	      Model 4--proportion of high fitness entities rapidly increases to
	      near 1.0
	\item
	      Model 5--both the proportion of offspring that are procreators
	      (rather than persistors) and the heritability of ability to procreate
	      increases over time to 1.0
\end{itemize}


\begin{enumerate}
	\item
	      Fitness independent of inheritance potential--as explored in
	      \autocite{Bourrat2015}--bias applied only to bias value of offspring, not fitness
	\item
	      fitness dependent on inheritance--more likely. A mechanism that doesn't copy well unlikely to preserve information leading to high
	      fitness\ldots{}--the parent's fidelity influences the offspring's fidelity, and to offspring's fitness
\end{enumerate}

\autocite{Bourrat2015} introduces a check-for-overcrowding step--is this necessary? Under endogenous selection shouldn't overcrowding also be endogenous?

General difficulties with earlier work:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Somewhat arbitrary choices of elements of description
	\item Genotype/Phenotype, Selection,\ldots{} often based on goal of rationalizing existing descriptions, so not a re-examination
	\item Lack causality--so hard to use as mechanism
	\item Leave options and alternatives for implementer
	\item Sheer number of EA algorithms
\end{itemize}

Proofs of effectiveness:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Base equations from Malthus and population genetics
	\item \autocite{Vose:1999di} for EAs
	\item Underlying assumptions should be maintained in our models
\end{itemize}

	\item Purpose of summaries as opposed to Formal models

\end{itemize}

Finally, in Artificial Life, Artificial Chemistries have been used in the exploration of open-ended or creative evolution. Squirm3 \parencite{Hutton2002,Hutton2009,Lucht2012} adopts fixed molecule types, and pre-defined reactions for replication and gene-sequence transcription, and so although capable of interesting behaviour is not capable of unlimited extension. Stringmol \parencite{Hickinbotham2011} - a bacterial inspired microprogram chemistry - though does demonstrate a rich heredity for open-ended evolution using string-matching to model binding between sequences, and RBN-World \parencite{Faulconbridge2011} shows that a form of Random Boolean Network, with the addition of a bonding mechanisms to allow for composition and decomposition of RBNs, can be used to build a chemistry capable of almost limitless extension out of non-traditional components.

Open-ended evolution can be seen as evolution in an open-ended system (\eg Chemistry), where an open-ended system has effectively unrestricted representation: the number of possible types must be much larger than the number of individuals (ideally without any restriction). Without this property all possible types can be generated in a finite time, and the system will either reach stasis or begin to repeat. Not all open-ended systems necessarily support evolution, but in those that do, our intuition suggests that open-ended evolution produces increasing complexity, increasing diversity, accumulation of novelty and continual adaptation \cite{Lehman2012}.

\quote{by open-ended evolutionary capacity we understand the potential of a system to reproduce its basic functional-constitutive dynamics, bringing about an un-limited variety of equivalent systems, of ways of expressing that dynamics, which are not subject to any predetermined upper bound of organizational complexity (even if they are, indeed, to the energetic-material restrictions imposed by a finite environment and by the universal physico-chemical laws)}{\cite{Ruiz-Mirazo2004}}

\begin{itemize}
	\item An open-ended evolutionary system must demonstrate unbounded diversity during its growth phase.
	\item An open-ended evolutionary system must embody selection.
	\item An open-ended evolutionary system must exhibit continuing (``positive'') new adaptive activity.
	\item An open-ended evolutionary system must have an endogenous implementation of niches.
\end{itemize} \cite{Maley:1999bs} (considered ``rather abstract'' by Hutton \parencite[p.341]{Hutton2002}).

\Textcite{Taylor2001,Taylor:1999sc} discuss creativity in \gls{oee} in depth and argues that, for it to be possible, the replicators must \parencite{Hutton2004}:\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*] \item Be fully embedded in their arena of competition \item Have rich, unlimited interactions between each other and with their environment \item Initially replicate implicitly, rather than using some encoding of the replication process, and \item Be constructed entirely of `material' components, allowing the possibility of different encodings of information. (\quote{the very stuff from which they are constructed is a valuable resource of matter and energy}{\cite[s3.6]{Taylor2001}})
\end{enumerate}

Bottom-up models for open-ended evolution leverage richness of underlying environment - less information in entity definition, more in environment definition. Similar to biology, where physics and chemistry underpin living organisms, where definition of minimal cell many orders of magnitude simpler than the working out of the chemical and physical rules that it relies upon.

Top-down models assume a knowledge of the necessary elements.

Limited heredity replicators vs unlimited - the first where the number of possible types is less than the number of individuals; the second where it far exceeds\cite{Szathmary:2006ty}

%Geb \cite{Channon:iw,Channon:2001ly} artificial organisms controlled by neural networks created by a developmental process from a bit-string genotype. Individuals interact with the world through five predefined types of interaction generated by the neural network - reproduce (crossover and mutation of production rules), fight, turn anti-clockwise or clockwise, move forward.

%RBN-World \cite{Faulconbridge2011} chemistry where the entities are described as a form of Random Boolean Network, with the addition of a bonding mechanisms to allow for composition and decomposition of RBNs. A number of parameters affect the behaviour of the chemistry, and so a series of experiments sampled from the parameter-space, and then used a GA, to search for interesting variants  as measured by non-catalysed loops (ideal measures of auto-catalytic sets and Hypercycles too rare for use as a measure) (\cite[§8]{Faulconbridge2011}). 

Ducharme et al \parencite{Ducharme2012}. The approach taken is to model the energy changes associated with reactions. The chemistry is spatial; atoms are arranged on a 2-dimensional grid and have velocity. When two atoms pass within a particular distance, they interact. The possible types of interactions are prespecified, with the type chosen being driven by the atomic composition and energies of the interacting atoms. Reactions are therefore between atoms rather than molecules; a molecule in this chemistry is a combination of atoms arranged in a particular structure, re-examined after each reaction to form a stable configuration based on expectations from real-world chemistry. Although computational costs are not reported, it seems plausible that the calculation of intersections on a 2-dimensional grid will be expensive for large molecular populations. Another cost comes from the re-arrangement of molecules into energy-efficient configurations. This spatial structuring enables the model to restrict atomic interactions to those atoms that are accessible on a molecule, but at the cost of additional modelling complexity.

			\item
			
			Lewontin variation, fitness differences, heritability of fitness
			
			\item
			
			Maynard-Smith variation, multiplication, heritability
			
			\item
			
			Greisemer 2000 states these are fundamentally different
			
			\item
			
			But if inheritance is statistical only then ok; but literature
			stresses digitally encoded although might just be cognitive bias
			
			\item
			
			Unit of selection very important to define now in abiogenesis
			
			\item
			
			Can evolution happen when information transfer is non-digital?
			Specifically where there is a parent-offspring correlation in
			molecular composition?
			
			\item
			
			Based on GARD Segre et al 1998
			
			
			\begin{itemize}
				\item
				
				Compositional inheritance
				
				\item
				
				claim made that GARD is capable of darwinian evolution, but
				population analysis showed not in response to directional selection
				(Vasas2010)
				
				\item
				
				Eigen threshold applies - mutation rates (see issue of replication -
				big differences between parent and child) overwhelm selection
				
			\end{itemize}
			\item
			
			Ganti and Eigen showed that distinct, organizationally different
			alternative autocatalytic networks in same environment might compete
			and fittest would prevail (e.g., autocatalytic networks as units of
			selection)
			
			
			\begin{itemize}
				\item
				
				Check number of network components (=autocatalytic networks). In
				GARD, end up with just one big component
				
			\end{itemize}
			\item
			
			GARD does not result in selectable replicating entities - there is no
			replication as certain highly catalytic molecules determine the
			properties of the compotype, and these are not inherited equally -
			instead a child may or may not inherit one of these molecules and so
			its properties may be similar to or very different from its parent
			
			\item
			
			Kauffman 1986 reflexively autocatalytic polymer networks however are
			evolvable. First, likelihood of such networks higher than expected
			(Hordijk and Steel) and second, in Vasas2012 putting these networks
			into compartments (so not well-stirred) then can do directional
			selection
			
			\item
			
			Differences between GARD and RAPN:
			
			
			\begin{itemize}
				\item
				
				kinetics of growth - RAPN has ligation, GARD does not. Ligation
				allows new components to be formed with new properties
				
				\item
				
				search for adaptations - GARD has fixed catalysis, Kauffman does not
				- mutant polymers can arise, be incorporated into the set, and
				influence its fitness
				
			\end{itemize}
			\item
			
			Minimal conditions for OEE
			
			
			\begin{itemize}
				\item
				
				very rich combinatorial generative mechanism e.g., organic
				chemistry. Underlies the evolvability of niches (Dorin and Korb
				2011)
				
				\item
				
				unlimited heredity - number of possible heritable types should
				astronomically exceed individuals in population
				(Maynard-Smith:1995lw)
				
				\item
				
				inexhaustible fitness landscape - implies rich, dynamical
				environment
				
				\item
				
				Cannot state in advance possible preadaptations. (not clear why this
				is a condition\ldots{}seems to be saying that evolution is
				algorithmic but results are not - are emergent) Richness part of
				real chemistry, not from representations of chemistry which are
				limited - necessary requirement for OEE in material systems. (But
				real chemistry is also limited...just not as much)

			core and periphery species, in sustained reaction)
			
			\item
			
			Suicidal autocatalysis - as reactions are reversible, if A + X

			Original ACS model (Kauffman and Farmer 1986)
			
			
			\begin{itemize}

				Food set of low complexity ( up to some length M of B types of

				\item
				
				Each molecule has probability (fixed and constant) P of catalyzing

			Objections and fixes to original model
			
			
			\begin{itemize}
				\item
				
				Issues with P - as length M of polymers increases, number of
				reactions possible increases faster than number of molecules
				possible, and so proportion of catalysed reactions rises - not
				realistic. Modification to model following Lifson to base P on joint
				probability of molecule is a catalyst, and molecule catalyses a
				particular reaction. Alternative seems more likely - that P is a per

					\item
					
					More reactions in the cycle, less likely to remain functional -
					problem of side reactions
					
					\item
					
					p reactions, si specificity (this reaction rather than another
					side reaction), turnover t, grows only if t* product all si's
					\textgreater{} 1
					
					\item
					
					Specificity limited for uncatalysed reactions (uncatalysed as
					assume before formation of enzymes, as enzymes are products of
					more complicated chemistry), so size of cycle limited
					
					\item
					
					Explains why know of only one or two (condensation reaction in
					Patzke and von Kiedrowski 2007) natural examples other than
					Formose, although some hypothetical archaic ones suggested
					
					\item
					
					Variations in cycle may not automatically be autocatalytic (why?
					because mutant copies generally not functional), and so not
					heritable variation
					
					\item
					
					Chemical avalanche model shows alternative - changes by
					adding/inventing new autocatalytic cycles (from products of rare
					side reactions) rather than by modifying existing ones
					
					
					\begin{itemize}
						\item
						
						Attractor based heredity, rather than storage (RNA/DNA) based
						(Hogeweg 1998)
						
						\item
						
						Random sample of molecules from a compartment ``inherits'' its
						state - same/similar molecules so same/similar autocatalytic
						cycles/states (particulate model of heredity?) (cycles created
						from seed molecules which are heritable)
						
						\item
						
						Obviously need multiple attractors/states for this to be
						meaningful - otherwise
						
						\item
						
						No real world support for this - although Formose cycle not
						fully understood and so still might resemble this Chemical
						Avalanche model

				Autocatalytic sets
				
				
				\begin{itemize}
					\item
					
					formed from autocatalytic loops - ``each molecule in the loop

					the steps is a catalytic dependency'' - just need one step where
					product is not consumed but acts as catalyst in next step for loop
					to maintain autocatalytic properties
					
					\item
					
					Loops grow because of catalysis, not because of stoichiometry (as
					in cycles). So much less subject to side reactions (why?)
					
					\item
					
					Inhibition in network permits more than one core/attracting
					network (Kauffman speculation). Same mechanism as for Chemical
					Avalanches, but here cycles are same as one-member autocatalytic
					loops.

						\item

			When two atoms pass within a particular distance, they interact. The

			being driven by the atomic composition and energies of the interacting

			\item
			
			Reactions are therefore between atoms rather than molecules; a
			molecule in this chemistry is a combination of atoms arranged in a
			particular structure, re-examined after each reaction to form a stable
			configuration based on expectations from real-world chemistry.
			
			\item
			
			Although computational costs are not reported, it seems plausible that
			the calculation of intersections on a 2-dimensional grid will be
			expensive for large molecular populations. Another cost comes from the
			re-arrangement of molecules into energy-efficient configurations. This
			spatial structuring enables the model to restrict atomic interactions
			to those atoms that are accessible on a molecule, but at the cost of
